It's been a critical part of Google's enterprise apps business ever since.\n  \n #4: ITA travel service, $700 million\n \u00a0Google made a $700 million bid for ITA, which compiles flight information for airlines, travel agencies \u2014 and rival search engines. The bid garnered complaints from competitors who rely on ITA's service, but the feds eventually approved it with conditions.\n  \n #3: AdMob mobile advertising, $750 million\n \u00a0Android is all about increasing mobile search usage today, but Google hopes to make mobile advertising in general into a huge business. That's why it paid $750 million for AdMob in November 2009. Since then, however, AdMob execs have left \u2014 including former CEO Omar Hamoui (pictured here) \u2014 and sources have said the integration isn't going so well.\n  \n #2: YouTube video sharing site, $1.65 billion\n \u00a0It looks like a no-brainer now, but when Google bought the video-sharing service in 2009, it was a huge risk: YouTube was full of copyrighted content that users uploaded without permission, and faced potentially billions in lawsuits. Google skillfully negotiated contracts with content owners and instituted a reasonable takedown policy, and as a result YouTube has thrived \u2014 analysts estimate it's now profitable and earns more than $1 billion a year. This year, Google is increasing headcount by 30% and is hiring tons of new ad sales people.\n  \n #1: DoubleClick display ad technology, $3.1 billion\n \u00a0The 2007 acquisition of DoubleClick launched Google into the display advertising business. It's been a mixed bag. Google boasts that it's making $2.5 billion a year from display, but about $1 billion of that is from YouTube. Also, display advertising isn't nearly as profitable for Google as its core search advertising business. Still, display advertising is a big business, and Google has to be in it.

(Oh and previously, AT&T didn't plan to hit 250 million people covered until 2014.)\n Also, it lays out how AT&T claims T-Mobile transaction makes it more palatable for it to cover 97 percent of the country in LTE, given the new economies of scale at play with the merger\u2014previously, senior management had thought it was untenable to cover more than 80 percent of the country with LTE, even though AT&T's marketing department thought otherwise. (AT&T marketing wants its network to be better perhaps more than any other segment in AT&T, I'd imagine. So they're on our side.)

Seems like everyone does. Cable television routinely scores lower in customer satisfaction than just about anything else\u2014including congress. So why don't you just switch providers? Oh yeah, you can't. You're so screwed!\n The sad truth is, most Americans don't have a choice of cable providers. Sure, there are a lot of cable companies out there, but odds are there's only one you can use. While no one cable company dominates the nation, there are a lot of regional cable fiefdoms. Live in San Francisco? It's Comcast for you. Atlanta? Cox. New York City? Time Warner. That matters because it translates into high prices and crummy service.\n Nationally speaking, there's plenty of competition. But locally, that's just not true. For the overwhelming majority of us it's the local cable-opoly, or get bent. Which means we pay exorbitant bills, suffer four hour install time windows, and just suck it up when our cable provider throttles our download speeds or caps our bandwidth.\n The only way this changes is with competition. When a competing cable company is present, your cable bill typically goes down by 15-percent, and service generally improves. But almost nobody has a competing cable company.\n Simply put, you're paying way too much for Nickelodeon.\n The cable industry is a patchwork of micro-monopolies. Or more accurately, natural monopolies: situations of little or no competition that doesn't break enough laws to get regulated. A natural monopoly occurs when it's so expensive to enter a market that it doesn't make sense for a competitors to come in. With cable TV, there's a massive fixed cost to enter a new market\u2014putting in new cable lines. So, basically, whoever showed up first\u2014or the company that bought them\u2014has the legacy right of being the local cable company.\n For decades, cable operators were allowed to set up exclusive regional franchises. A cable company would come into an area, and more or less tell the municipal area in charge of franchising that it needed an exclusive for the next, say, 12-15 years if it was going to build out lines. That ended in 1992 with the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, but the damage was done.\n Cable companies had already divided up the nation like Europe colonizing Africa. By the time regulation arrived, the land grab was already over.\n The last reliable statistic shows that a mere 2-percent of American markets had a choice of cable providers. That's from 2003, the last time the FCC produced a statistic. (At least that they could supply us with.) You may be surprised to learn that the FCC doesn't have anything to do with cable franchising. Nor does the FTC. An FTC spokesman told Gizmodo that \"we don't look at industries considered common carriers, like airlines, phone companies and utilities.\"\n Throughout most of cable's history, it's been regulated at the local level. Counties and cities were the agencies responsible for allowing cable franchises. That is changing, slightly. More than 20 states now have franchise authority, due largely to intensive lobbying by telcos like Verizon and AT&T.\n You know you're fucked when you're relying on AT&T to make things better.\n Ultimately, this patchwork of local regulation means cable companies themselves are often more powerful than the body overseeing them. And as long as none of the micro-monopolies grows too large nationally, it can continue to control the local weather.\n But what about those second cable companies that some people have? They're typically overbuilders, a company that builds new lines in an area where one cable company already exists. They tend to be quite small. The best known, for example, is probably WideOpenWest Networks, or WOW. WOW has just 410,000 subscribers. And that's because it's really, really hard for a second company to come into an existing market.\n While everyone has a right to access the poles, the same isn't true of the wires that hang from them. In short, if you're an upstart cable company coming into a new area, you have to run your own lines. It's very expensive, and it also means you can easily be crushed by the existing monopoly.\n One cable industry insider, who would only speak on background, explained how it works:\n First you have to overcome a mishmash of local regulations. You have to get a permit to come in, which can be a legal hassle, with a wait time of many months just to get approval. Then its time to build.\n To build a new network and make it price-competitive, you have to reach 100-percent of customers in that area. Which means building an extensive network of lines, all the way to the door. If you're very lucky you may capture 10 to 20-percent of the market. You do that by offering steep discounts on bundled services. This gets you new customers, but at a loss.\n Then, Comcast, or Cablevision, or Time Warner\u2014or whichever provider is dominant in the area\u2014comes along behind you with sweetheart deals for any of its customers who were leaving. They offer discounted packages and teaser rates. Poof. They're gone. That's five percent of the market. Now you've spent a fortune on new lines and infrastructure, for very few new customers.\n So there's very little financial incentive for a competitor to try to build. It's just too damn hard to build a customer base. To do that, you need to be a giant company to begin with. Like, say, a telco.\n If you're lucky, you may have the option for Verizon FiOS or AT&T U-Verse. But probably not. Verizon only passes (cable lingo for is available at) 15 million premises nationwide, and has just 3.7 million video subscribers. AT&T is even smaller, at 3.2 million. Comcast, by comparison, has 22 million video subscribers.\n What's more, there's no evidence that telcos are having a positive effect on pricing. In fact, in some areas where AT&T managed to get the laws changed, like Michigan, prices have gone up.\n But wait! What about satellite? Doesn't satellite fix everything? No.\n According to the Government Accountability Office, satellite services have little-to-no effect on cable prices. (And besides, satellite service is terrible. Who doesn't want to watch TV when it's overcast outside?)\n Ultimately what all of this means is that consumers are left with little recourse. Because there's plenty of competition nationally, nobody is looking out for you locally.\n Except us.\n All this week, Gizmodo is going to take a long-hard look at the cable industry, and how to improve it.

We listened in and got a little rare insight into how the Nexus program works.\n When your kid asks you, \"Mommy, where do Nexuses come from?\" now you'll have an answer.\n The Nexus program is what Google uses to raise the bar for hardware manufacturers. It's gotta run the latest and greatest version of Android, and it's gotta run it well. Every year around Christmas time, Google picks a hardware manufacturer to make the next Nexus phone. They then have about nine months to build it. Interesting. We knew that Google works closely with whomever is building their next Nexus, but it sounds like Google is calling the shots even more than we thought. It would appear that they say what they need, and then manufacturers climb over each other and bid to build the thing.\n You might be wondering if Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility will give Motorola a leg up. Google says no, they will have to bid to build it just like everyone else. Hooray for competition!\n On the call there was also a lot of mention of in-home devices, which was a surprise since the purchase was for Motorola Mobility (Moto's mobile devision), specifically. Motorola's CEO Sanjay Jha said, \"There is a great convergence between the mobile world and the content that enters the home through the set top boxes.\" Could this mean Motorola will play a key role in the evolution of Google TV? Time will tell.\n You might wonder why Google just blew $12.5 bil on Motorola if they aren't going to be the next Nexus factory. The answer lies not only in the 17,000+ patents Motorola already owns, but also in the thousands more that Moto has \"in-process.\" Google wouldn't say exactly how they'll leverage those against the many lawsuits that have been leveled against them, but they did say that they feel this acquisition will better protect them.\n So, will the next next Nexus be made by Moto? Well, the last rumors still point to Samsung, which would make two in a row for the big S, following last year's Nexus S, but you know how these rumors go, and there may yet be a Moto surprise for us all.\n  You can keep up with Brent Rose, the author of this post, on Google+ or Twitter. \n Related Stories  The Most Interesting Tablet You've Never Heard Of\n\n Why Does This Phone Have a License Plate?\n\n Firefox 6 Is Out Ahead of Schedule", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-15 15:40:27"}}, {"pk": 149, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:37:55", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830842/google-is-buying-motorola", "wikiarticles": [14260687, 1275656, 30332078, 3144730, 20319, 1092923, 468431, 24855387, 12610483], "title": "Google Is Buying Motorola", "content": "Google Is Buying Motorola\n  Crazy news just in\u2014Google is acquiring the handset division of Motorola, Motorola Mobility, for $12.5 billion.

Samsung, HTC, et al, are going to need another avenue of attack, since Motorola branded products are going to theoretically have a major advantage, even if Google insists they're going to have to compete like every other phonemaker.\n \u2022 What does this mean for Google's retail skills? They totally boned the original Nexus launch. On the one hand, now they've got Motorola's supply chain and competencies. On the other hand, Motorola lately hasn't been all that amazing (3 percent share, and that's with the most visible Android brand name on the market).\n \u2022 Motorola's got something like 21 Android handsets. Does that mean we're suddenly going to have two dozen phones running stock Android? That would be kind of incredible. At the same time, other OEMs are probably going to be even more aggressive with their skins so that they can \"differentiate.\" In an ideal world, they're forced to find a way to actually improve the Android experience. In reality, they're probably just going to screw it up more.\n [Businesswire and TNW]\n Update: A blog post on Google's official blog states that part of the attraction for Google was Motorola's generous (17,000) handful of patents, with CEO Larry Page writing:\n  \"We recently explained how companies including Microsoft and Apple are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on Android. The U.S. Department of Justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to \"protect competition and innovation in the open source software community\" and it is currently looking into the results of the Nortel auction. Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies.\"\n  Just in case you had little doubt in your mind, patents are the new basketball cards.\n  MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. & LIBERTYVILLE, Ill., Aug 15, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) \u2014 Google Inc.

Privately, I don't care if it's your birthday. I secretly hate you. But society now forces me to acknowledge your virtual existence. \n So, if you're anything like me\u2014admit it\u2014you feel like a willful prisoner of the accepted technologies of the day. It's not just about keeping track of the people you don't truly care about. That's one thing. It's that there are \"close friends\" in your life that you don't give two shits about, but still have to RSVP to their asinine Facebook events or @reply them on Twitter. Close only because you share a few too many drunken pictures together.\n But, for one reason or another, you can't break the friendship. Breaking up is hard to do, be it for complicated group associations or having to see them everyday. So what can you do? Lie. And lie well.\n Be as Passive Aggressive as Possible\n Let's face it. If you were one of those \"I say what I mean when I mean it\" types, you wouldn't have this problem. That kind of honesty sucks. Hell, the only reason I write this now is because the people in my life that this applies to don't read Gizmodo\u2014if you do, you're safe. You can trust me. So, the only feasible way to go about keeping friends off your back is by keeping them at a distance while making it seem like you care.\n That means you can't go off grid. You can't just turn off your accounts, because A) The friends you actually care about are still there, and B) Having more friends/followers is cool. Don't be stupid and risk losing your friend count. And for all you know, your actual friends hate you and are playing this exact game with you. You're stuck.\n Know What You Use\n I barely use my Tumblr these days. I don't worry too much about what's happening on LinkedIn, though I'll be sure to change some of my settings ASAP. Really, my social networks of choice are Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Foursquare, and Google+. In that order. So my behavior in these spaces naturally informs how and when I lie. You need to know what you habitually use and how they connect before you can be an effective liar. Otherwise, you'll get caught or stuck going to a party or baby shower you don't want to be seen at.\n Also keep in mind that a lot of the services you use will, by design, try to keep you honest. Not because they esteem honesty as to shun those who break the 8th/9th Commandment. Rather, telling the truth is just easier. For a computer. You, on the other hand, are human. You should celebrate that fact. Therefore!\n Be Creative... Within Reason\n Scenario. A few of your friends have invited you to hang out for old times' sake. You haven't seen them in some time, and it really would be nice to catch up. Only they live across state lines, and your last bender has left you a little broke.\n Simple solution right? Just tell them you can't come out. You're all adults. They'll understand. Except you let things get to the last minute, and if you flake you look like a bastard. Considerably more complicated. Now what? Well, you could start with a few well-placed tweets or status updates, like \"Ugh I feel awful\" or \"I can't believe this happened!\" +1 an article on WebMD. Instagram a sad puppy. All stuff that's specific enough to catch their eye but vague enough as to not feel forced. Later, when you have that talk to break plans, you'll likely hear, \"Yeah I saw your [insert here]. Everything ok?\" Perfect.\n Take it a step further. Say you opt with the \"My dog died\" range of excuses. Like saying your father got into a car accident and you need to rush to his side. Don't check into the hospital on Foursquare. It's classless, hurts your credibility, and you won't get points for it. Instead, a few choice tweets from the trip here and there is enough to get some sympathy and good will. But be careful! Never overdo it. Short of paying people off, you don't wanna wind up having no one to corroborate your story.\n Always Have a Plan\n Ultimately, this is a numbers game. The law of averages has it that you're gonna screw up somehow and get caught in a lie. Now, if it's little enough you can talk your way out of it, provided you come prepared. It's just like how in Catholic school they teach that lies only beget more lies. That's not so terrible if you know what you're doing.\n Now, you just stood up a date, telling him you have to do some work. But they just busted you. It wasn't hard. You just tweeted how great a time you're having at the party you ditched him for. You even checked in at the location. Been there, done that. All you have to do is send a picture of yourself doing something domestic. A picture you smartly took of yourself beforehand. Then sober up the best you can, and make a phone call from a quiet place to allay any suspicions. Tell him you were making gentle fun of the friend who's party you're at right now. She never even invited you, but you found out on Facebook anyway. The bitch. It sounds ridiculous\u2014it is\u2014but by now you've got him laughing. Good. While it's not the most airtight of solutions, it sows enough reasonable doubt to get you out of hot water.\n However, if it's a big enough lie...\n Be Prepared to Confess\n Well, you can't win 'em all. Sometimes you get caught, and you have to keep it real. This is a good thing. Friendship should not be taken lightly, and lying is wrong. But most importantly, getting caught keeps your sharp for next time. So be ready for it, because it's gonna happen eventually. Don't be afraid to beg for forgiveness. It may not come lightly. It may not come at all. If it does, good for you. You keep a friend, and maybe you can begrudge them a little more respect. If not, who needs them? Either way, lesson learned.\n And remember...\n You Are Not a Sociopath\n You're just a victim of circumstance. There's no reason you shouldn't use your know-how to get out of a tight spot, and you'll probably need that know-how more these days. The ubiquity of all things social network-y means that you'll find yourself in all sorts of situations that demand you deal with people's bullshit. And people's bullshit can overlap and overwhelm in surprising and uncomfortable ways. No one has 900 friends in real life. At the same time, having even 50 regular friends bombarding you with their lives and plans can be very stressful. This is about survival. I'll concede that honesty is still the best policy. But, even for the most noble among you, a good lie can be an excellent back-up.\n  You can keep up with Kwame Opam, the author of this post, on Twitter, Facebook, and occasionally Google+. \n Related Stories  How to Break Your Daily Caffeine Habit and Use Coffee Strategically\n\n How to Take a Gorgeous Photo Like This on a Perfect Summer Night\n\n How To Remove Your Personal Information From Background Check Websites", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-13 17:00:00"}}, {"pk": 153, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:39:34", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830488/facebook-messenger-cocktails-super-8-cams-panoramic-pictures-and-more", "wikiarticles": [16115172, 28030496, 19194005, 19471135, 30126723, 7529378, 24855387, 12610483], "title": "Facebook Messenger, Cocktails, Super 8 Cams, Panoramic Pictures and More", "content": "See the rest of this week's best iPhone apps  The week's best Android apps\n \nPano: It's a panoramic picture taking app for your Android phone.

They're stunning, every bit as good as anything shot with a DSLR. And that's because they are shot with a DSLR. Which sucks.\n If you aren't familiar with it, Instagram is a social networking and camera tool that lives entirely in an iPhone app. You take pictures, apply filters (or not) and share them on Instagram, which can also pipe them to Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, Tumblr and a variety of other social networks.\n Instagram does not have a web-upload option. It barely has a website. It's entirely mobile, and photos can only be sought-out through the app. Sure, each photo generates its own URL, but you can only get that URL if the photo is posted on another service like Facebook. And that's kind of the beauty of the whole thing. It celebrates our increasingly mobile culture. It tags along with your friends everywhere they go, tucked away in their blue jeans and messenger bags. Occasionally, they pull it out of their pockets, and share what they're seeing. And suddenly there you are, with them, connected to one another through a piece of hardware descended from a technology that was created specifically to connect people. I can't be the only one who finds that wonderful.\n There is obviously no right way to Instagram. You use it for what you use it for. But certainly it's a social network that tracks what's going on now. When describing Instagram to friends who haven't used it, I don't talk about the filters, or the quality of the photos, I talk about how it lets me see what my friends are doing right now.\n It is the quicker Flickr; a visual Twitter.\n And so when you post photos from yesterday, or last week, or even a few hours ago that you took with your standalone camera, imported to your computer, processed with an app, and then synced back to your phone, you're slowing it down. Breaking the flow. It's not wrong, per se, but it violates the spirit of the app.\n It is, after all, Instagram, not Latergram.\n There are a lot of places to showcase great photography online. Flickr, Picassa, Smugmug. I fully expect to see lots of awesome, highly processed shots of Fireworks on those sites on July 5 and July 6 and, Hell, even July 10. But on Instagram if I'm seeing fireworks shots a day or two later it's a little jarring. Moreover, if everyone starts using it the way my friend does, it's going to kill it. Instead of a window, it will become an archive.\n And to be clear, this has nothing to do with the gamification features on Instagram. Sure, everybody loves to get their own little hearts and stars. But who cares how many likes somebody else's stuff gets? Ultimately, it's not about that.\n I don't care how many hearts my buddy gets; I'd just prefer to see where he is today instead of where he was yesterday.\n  You can keep up with Mat Honan, the author of this post, on Twitter, Facebook, or Google+. \n Related Stories  Talking With Your Earbuds in: Rude or Not Rude?\n\n When Chat Attacks: How To Instant Message Without Wasting Your Day or Being a Jerk\n\n Rdio-Rolling: The Best New Way to Punk Your Friends", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-12 20:00:00"}}, {"pk": 156, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:40:30", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830424/nerf-n+strike-deploy-cs+6-is-the-office-warfare-deal-of-the-day", "wikiarticles": [27722419, 28340860, 838392, 19682791, 18711859, 988689, 25352629, 5522248, 45876, 157299], "title": "Nerf N-Strike Deploy CS-6 Is the Office Warfare Deal of the Day", "content": "I'd describe myself as a pretty peaceful guy.

It became so addictive that I exchanged it for an iPod touch. Now I'm shopping for a new addiction. \n Although we had our good times, I eventually came to feel that I was losing something of myself in the pairing. The device was there with me in social situations and solitary ones, making each moment more informative but also less rich. I found it hard to create good boundaries - especially because out of the two of us, I was the only one trying. Mostly, the iPhone was depriving me of quiet mind space. Gone were all the many once-taken-for-granted in between moments where I would mentally process my day or just stare into space.\n Instead, those minutes became full of tasks: catch up on Words With Friends, scroll through Facebook. I was rewarded by little bursts of dopamine, delivered at a variable rate that kept me coming back like a senior at the slots. I felt little embarrassment about my ties to this thing, if only because most people I know were in the throes of a similar relationship. On subways, on street corners, on road trips, at restaurants, I sometimes looked up and all around me saw everyone else looking down. I felt sad for all these people absorbed in their machines, missing out on the parts of life that operate without cell reception. But then I'd point my head right back down.\n iPhone cold turkey\n I didn't go cold turkey: when I gave away the iPhone, I replaced it with an iPod Touch. It's the methadone to the iPhone's heroin. The Touch has a lot of the useful stuff that I like about the iPhone, but it can only access email or texts or Facebook when there's an unlocked wireless Internet.\n What peace this little device has ferried into my psyche! Turn off the Internet, and the whole world feels like Walden Pond.\n Like Thoreau, I went to the woods of our technological landscape:\n  because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived\u2026I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.\n  However, I found that digital solitude could translate into real-world loneliness: At dinner parties, everyone else was bowing at the table with the blue light glowing on their faces. A couple times, I pulled out a book-reading being a habit about which I'm happy to be compulsive. But it took me out of the situations almost as much as my iPhone had. Hoping for a way to stay engaged while also keeping my hands from fidgeting during those awkward social moments where I'm the only person not plugged into the grand switchboard, I decided to explore the virtues of cigarettes.\n Addictions tend to be fungible. Switching seats on the Titanic, I've heard it called. According to TechCrunch, technology is the new smoking. Alexis Tsotsis' recent post references a new British study that says that a study found 53 percent of its participants felt \"upset\" after a mandated day off the web; 40 percent felt \"lonely.\" Many compared it to quitting smoking.\n Why smoking is better than the smartphone\n I've yet to take up the habit, but I've started to consider some of the reasons why smoking might just be better for me than using a smartphone (if smoking wouldn't kill you and caused all kind of bad things):\n \u2022 Cigarettes could help me better interact with people. I can carry on a conversation while smoking. I'd be forced to occasionally interact with others. \"Excuse me, do you have a light?\" I'm guessing more love connections have been made with those words than through OKCupid. Though maybe not for much longer.\n \u2022 Activities that are easier to do with a cigarette than with an iPhone: Walk without tripping, talk on the phone, bicycle, stare into the sky.\n \u2022 They have monetary value, and I think this makes one more accountable. Most smokers I know have a pretty good idea of how much they smoke in a given week, and how much they spend. I have no idea how much iPhone time I was logging with my unlimited data plan. If I'd had to pay per minute, I would've at least made an attempt to budget my usage.\n \u2022 Cigarettes take a fixed amount of time to smoke. They're distractions with built in timers. Smoking allows the perfect amount of time for a break. The \"breaks\" I've taken to use an iPhone usually go on longer than planned and leave me more mentally exhausted than when I started.\n \u2022 If you smoke, at least you're a smoker. You can say \"I have to go smoke\" and people understand that you have an addiction you have to feed. You're hooked. But you're not necessarily an asshole. Not so if you must excuse yourself from a baby shower because you need to check Instagram.\n \u2022 Smoking is obvious. Someone can see you're smoking. Afterwards, you smell like you were smoking. It's hard to hide. But when my accountant stops mid-sentence to look at his device, how do I know what kind of Facebook message I'm competing with?\n \u2022 You can live off the grid and the cancer sticks still work. Anonymous can't steal your nicotine password, and Apple can't use your cigarette's GPS to track you. Your Marlboro never demands you download an update.\n \u2022 When a pack of cigarettes falls into the toilet, you don't have to fish them out, dry them off and pray. Although you can if you want. Leave your Parliaments at a beer garden? Totally not a big deal.\n When you're using tobacco, you are supporting a company that is at least somewhat straightforward regarding the harmful nature of their products. No warning labels on the iPhone. In fact, people are giving them to their kids and using them in cars.\n \u2022 It's too early to come to any firm conclusion regarding the health effects of using cell phones. Illnesses caused by smoking, on the other hand, are well understood. There's a richer library of information on the effects of cigarettes. I'm thinking there's a better chance at helping people suffering from smoking-related maladies than to aid those dealing with unknown monsters like phone-induced brain cancer or Angry Birds Addiction.\n \u2022 Cigarettes are less taxing on your hands. I didn't even realize how much my thumbs were hurting from many months of iPhone emailing and texting until I gave up the habit.\n \u2022 It is way sexier to light up a cigarette after sex then to light up a smart phone. Especially when there is a passcode involved.\n I know more people who have successfully given up cigarettes than have given up using a smart phone.\n Aesthetically, I prefer the cigarette to the iPhone. There's a uniformity to people's digital habits that I find troublesome. The devices all look pretty much the same, and most of the people I know do not have writerly email flourishes they use, or wildly distinctive looking websites, or texting habits that differentiate them greatly from all the other people in my contacts. Every text conversation looks alike. I'm left longing for the kind of differentiation one finds among smokers. My friend Christa only smokes Nat Sherman's, which are charming in their brownness as they sit on her lips. Marie keeps her Marlboro Lights deep in between her ring and middle fingers, wrapping the rest of her hand around her face while she drags in. And the smell of Camels, unfiltered, forever will remind me of my father.\n Lately, however, he smells less smokey. Doctors orders, he's given it up. I don't know if it's just a coincidence that this event has neatly dovetailed with the acquisition of his very first cell phone. He sings its praises. It even has an address book in it, he tells me. Two weeks after getting it, it fell into the toilet. I asked him how he felt.\n \"Completely bereft.\"\n  Anna Jane Grossman is a New York writer.

Anonymous has singled out Facebook for its shady privacy settings and for how difficult it is for users to delete their accounts.\n Facebook, the voice-garbled orator says, \"gives users the illusion of (privacy) and hides the details away from them \"for their own good\" while they then make millions off of you.\" When all is said and done, the group claims people will thank Anon for saving them from the evils of Zuck's empire. [YouTube via Business Insider and Village Voice]\n Update: Sources we've spoken to inside Anonymous' IRC have cast some heavy, heavy doubt upon the legitimacy of #OpFacebook. Unlike Anonymous' major offensives, which have the blessing of the collective's prominent operators, the Facebook takedown is more of a splinter maneuver. \"#OPFacebook is not endorsed by Anonops at this time,\" stated one member. The generally-reputable AnonOps Twitter feed confirms as much. Another IRC member put it more clearly:\n  Anonymous is a mindset not a group. Mindsets do not have leaders. With any given operation there are always some who agree and some who disagree. With opFaceBook specifically there are those that agree and those that disagree. Annoymous allows each person individually to vote on each operation, a yes vote means they participate, a no vote means they do not. Anyone is allowed to create an op and if others vote yes it will get traction and something may be accomplished.\n  Essentially, this is a turkey without a head. It's possible some members of Anonymous may try to attack Facebook, but without the blessing and organization of Anonymous' chief operators, it's doubtful Facebook will be scratched, much less destroyed. Especially with months of forewarning.\n  You can keep up with Kelly Hodgkins, the author of this post, on Twitter, Google + or Facebook. Update 2: A fellow claiming to be the originator of #OpFacebook says the whole thing was a terrible mistake and misunderstanding.

Right now, Exxon is still number one at 352.9 billion compared to Apple's 346.74 billion.\n But even if Apple's stock market capitalization were actually higher than Exxon's, would it be a more valuable company? The answer is probably no. \n The rise of Apple\n It's amazing that a company like Apple has been able to reach a giant like ExxonMobil in market capitalization. A couple decades ago it was just an overpriced beige box manufacturer with an obsolete operating system. I remember because I was a Mac fanboy then, when everyone was using Windows and Michael Dell said that the company should be sold as scrap and the money returned to its shareholders.\n Then Steve came back.\n After the iPod, Mac OS X, the iPhone, and iPad, Apple has become the number one technology company in the world. Bar none. There's no company with better style, design sense, attention to detail, marketing and manufacturing precision. Apple is the best, and that's why most consumers crave its products. That's why the rest of the industry follows Cupertino too, even into entirely new markets.\n It was Steve Jobs' unique vision and his strict command of a brilliant troop of engineers that made\u2014and still makes\u2014it all possible. Together, they created the future. Now Apple is the new Microsoft, and they control it all\u2014from the hardware to the operating systems to the apps their operating systems run.\n The energy behemoth\n ExxonMobil represents the past, a much-hated American multinational that started with John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil company. The largest of the oil companies and the company with the largest market capitalization in the world right now. They own oil fields, natural gas fields, liquified natural gas factories, tankers and gas stations all across the planet. Some even say that, together with the other big six oil companies, ExxonMobil runs the world.\n They also make a lot more money than Apple. In the first quarter of 2011, ExxonMobil made a $10.65 billion in profit. Apple made $6 billion.\n You could say that there's little vision at ExxonMobil, that the company's money comes out of the ground. There is no Steve Jobs, just liquid gold. Pump it and those billions will keep coming in.\n Even in the middle of oil scarcity, they profit. Prices just go up, and that's the end of it. And because they own this whole energy business thing, and unless someone comes up with cold fusion in a can, they could probably keep doing this for several decades.\n Where would I put my money\n So, if I could invest money in the companies I write about, which one would be my pick?\n As much as I hate the oil guys, I'd pick ExxonMobil for one single reason: They don't have the invaluable advantage and the problem that Apple has.\n ExxonMobil doesn't depend on the man with the vision, the Wizard of Oz, the snake oil salesman, the amazingly brilliant asshole that is Steve Jobs.\n I used to think that Apple could live without Jobs. Back in 2008 I wrote about how he was preparing his farewell and why I thought that, if he left, the company would be just fine. I was wrong.\n Back then, investors disagreed with me. When we broke the news of the return of his cancer back in 2008, Apple lost billions in just a few minutes of trading. Back then, Apple and its friends at CNBC tried to deny the news that later was confirmed by Jobs himself.\n The investors were right, and now I'm convinced that Apple can't be Apple without Steve.\n Steve Jobs' health is probably not going to improve. Eventually\u2014hopefully later rather than sooner\u2014he will be gone. And that will be the beginning of the end for Apple, I'm afraid. Just like it happened with Microsoft and Sony, the company will enter its decline. It will not disappear or crash. It will not go down right away. I'm sure that there's plenty of magical stuff in Apple labs now. But it won't last forever.\n But even during the past few months I have noticed the slipping. Even while they made their best quarter in history, there are signs that execution and vision at the company are failing\u2014from the typography in their ads to the faults of Lion and some of the design decisions in iOS.\n The future\n So, ask yourself the same question: Would you put your stock in a company that can print money even when the oil fields are burning or in money that depends on a genius that may not be with us at any given time?\n What is really the most valuable company, ExxonMobil or Apple?\n \n Related Stories  MiniMash Lets You Pretend to Be an iPad DJ While It Does All the Work\n\n Amazon Student Lets College Kids Trade In Their Hated Textbooks\n\n BGR Claims 4G LTE iPhone 5 Is Being Tested on Carriers", "watchers": [3], "published": "2011-08-09 22:00:00"}}, {"pk": 159, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:41:19", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830263/why-did-apple-obliterate-a-galaxy-from-the-lion-wallpaper", "wikiarticles": [26727046, 28625065, 268287, 26199034, 16988558, 412326, 12558, 31353, 889902, 2336870], "title": "Why Did Apple Obliterate a Galaxy From the Lion Wallpaper?", "content": "Why Did Apple Obliterate a Galaxy From the Lion Wallpaper?\n  Now there are two reasons to change Apple's generic OS X 10.7 wallpaper to a custom one: it's a fake.

Tap the sync button on the top right and tap sync contacts. Turn off syncing.\n If you're on an Android phone, go the main menu, and click on Settings. Under Other Settings, select Sync Contacts.

If I was 15 today, I'd probably do the same things but with skinny jeans on. Not Nick D'Aloisio. He's a 15-year-old kid who makes iPhone apps. And I made him cry. \n If you don't know who D'Aloisio is, he's the kid who made Trimit\u2014an app that shortens websites into something more digestable. Fast Company just wrote an profile on D'Aloisio and called him \"business savvy\" with \"undoubted technical skills\" and \"makes regular old entrepreneurs seem like slackers.\" Pretty high praise, I'd say. So how'd a no-business-sense-having, minimal-technical-skills-possessing 'ol me make this kid cry?\n Here's some background: I'm the \"app guy\" for Gizmodo. Developers e-mail me about their apps and I try to respond to as many as I can as possible, but sometimes, the breaks are the breaks, you know? When D'aloisio first contacted me to cover Trimit, I thought the app's premise sounded interesting enough so I responded saying I'd love to check it out and asked him to send me the details. I also had no idea he was 15-years-old. And then it began.\n To put it bluntly, D'aloisio raped my inbox. And then he raped it again and again and again and again til infinity. And then again. Over the course of a few days, D'aloisio berserker barraged me with over a hundred e-mails about Trimit. I saw him go from calm to excited to a nervous wreck to suffering a nervous break down to threatening to bat shit crazy to borderline suicidal. Here's how it went (each line is a different e-mail FYI):\n  How are you finding trimit? Could you possibly do a post? We'd be so appreciative if you could!\n Could you give me an update regarding an article?\n Are we going to please get a post? We now have over 10 five star reviews and are in top 20 of utilities!\n Casey? Are we going on at 6pm?\n Casey?\n  And then he gets a little on edge:\n  Please reply?! We really need to know if we can get this article out today?\n Casey?\n Please Casey. This is putting the app at jeopardy. Can you just tell me if you could do an article or not?\n Are we likely to be app of the day?\n I'm becoming saddened now :) We really need to know what's going on! Why aren't you replying?\n Nick\n  After I informed him we wouldn't do a standalone post on his app, he kept going:\n  casey? Is it possible? Its cool if not.\n Could you just reply telling us if you could do a real short post (literally!) tonight as well as the App of the Weeks? Thanks for considering it.\n ?\n Casey? Any chance of something today?\n ?\n  At this point, he got fed up with my response time and started e-mailing everyone on the Gizmodo staff. From my bosses to the interns to everyone in between, no one was left out. They all got poked and prodded to the point where annoying wouldn't even accurately describe it. It was like being stuck babysitting the drunk annoying girl at a party you don't even want to be at. And if that party was in hell and the drunk annoying girl started vomiting on you. And if that vomit was actually soul-melting lava. You get the point. Everyone was sick of this half-baked app.\n So, in an admittedly dick move by us, we featured his app as the worst app of the week. Realizing our childish behavior might jeopardize someone's job (at this point he had told us his boss wanted status updates), we just pulled the app completely. It was a promising concept but the app just wasn't good enough. After seeing his app pulled from our Best Apps of the Week list, Nick fell apart (again, each line is a separate e-mail):\n  I can't believe this. Please just put us back on the list. Anywhere.\n I feel like crying I'm that disappointed. Please.\n You don't understand what this means if we don't get featured. We'll go bust and I'll end up unemployed.\n Why have you done this. I can't actually believe this is happening.\n Please, seriously Casey, don't destroy my livelihood.\n I'll do anything just please put us back. Seriously I'll do anything I can't let my boss see this.\n We'd planned so much marketing and SEO for this feature. Now we're not going to get the visibility and get into debt. Casey, you must understand what this will do to us if you don't put us back on the list. I thought you liked the app, why do you want to destroy it.\n Come on man, please forgive me. We all make mistakes. Why didn't you tell me days ago to stop emailing you! I thought you weren't getting them, that's why I kept sending them.\n Seriously without this feature we will lose ranking and then we won't pay back our purchases and then will have to stop the business.\n I plea for you to put it back to how it was before. I plea.\n Now we've wasted $10,000 as we dont have the article to accompany the efforts.\n That puts us in debt and we can't pay that back for ourselves so now I'm going to have to go without food for the next month.\n I am new, we've just started the startup, and I've never been in PR so I'm not familiar with these journalistic conducts and etiquettes I seem to have broken. I was not meaning to hurt any of you guys or disrupt your work at all; none of that was intentional. I WILL GET FIRED now because of all of this but I guess I can't change what has happened now. Our marketing has failed since we were not featured and now I have massive debt which is my responsibility to fix.\n I'll ask you for the final time to understand the seriousness of the situation and change it back to the way it was. What is stopping you? Why ruin my livelihood and my app? Why would you want that, seriously?\n Please man. Please.\n I really need to know what's going on! My boss is asking.\n  Do I feel like a complete ass now that I know he's a 15-year-old kid? Absolutely. He's a kid who was trying to do big boy things and almost pulled it off. His app might even be useful if it had a little more time in the oven. If I wanted to invest in an app developer, I'd put Nick D'Aloisio through etiquette school, manners class, drill him with social skills and most importantly, teach him the basics of how e-mails work (or maybe just strip him of e-mail rights altogether) and then I'd let him work. The kid got unhinged at what happened with the coverage of his app (I would be too at 15) but he obviously has the sort of so-insane-it-might-be-great passion for this.\n So do I wish I never made him cry? Of course, I was 15 once. Do I also wish he only sent me one e-mail? Heh.\n   You can keep up with Casey Chan, the author of this post, on Twitter or Facebook. \n Related Stories  MiniMash Lets You Pretend to Be an iPad DJ While It Does All the Work\n\n Amazon Student Lets College Kids Trade In Their Hated Textbooks\n\n Apple's iPad Cinemax Softcore Porn Problem", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-11 20:37:08"}}, {"pk": 163, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:42:08", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830010/the-lost-origins-of-the-stopwatch-a-story-of-racehorses-and-scrappy-startups", "wikiarticles": [27945098, 11447, 17883312, 6615345, 27944981, 60883, 10221371, 767894, 956704, 2951894], "title": "The Lost Origins of the Stopwatch: A Story of Racehorses and Scrappy Startups", "content": "The Lost Origins of the Stopwatch: A Story of Racehorses and Scrappy Startups\n  Stopwatch. No big deal. You've got one on your wrist, or even on your phone. But it didn't used to be like that. It took a very fast horse and an enterprising company to bring the super-accurate timepiece to America.\n It all started in 1855, when horse racing was a very big deal in the U.S. Tensions between the North and South were playing out on the track. Lexington was a middle-state star with a few successes under his belt when he accepted a challenge to run against the clock. After a series of faster than average loops, Lexington crossed the finish line just 7 minutes, 19 and three-quarter seconds. He had won a battle with a European-imported timepiece, which confirmed a world speed record that would last two decades.\n It was literally the fastest thing anyone had ever seen. So when Lexington blazed around the track and then through the papers, the instrument that gave him his record (timed to the quarter second) also got national\n interest.\n The American Watch Company wanted to tap that enthusiasm. They didn't make the stopwatch that timed Lexington - until then stopwatches were made one at a time by hand. But the company was first in the world to produce machine-made timepieces of the non-stopwatch variety. To change the way the watch was made, they had to completely change the watch. It was classic case of small start up taking on the establishment. And if they could do it with any old time keeper, why not a watch that measures the seconds on demand?\n They became the first to mass-produce the stopwatch, and put out 200 of them between 1859 and 1861. The American Watch Company called it the \"sporting watch,\" and it sold for $50 - up to $300 less than fancy imported models.\n The machine-made stopwatch was patented in 1859 and it was small, about two inches in diameter. \"The dial was distinctive,\" explains the Smithsonian National Museum of American History curator Carlene Stephens. \"The center hand circled the dial once in four minutes. The smaller hand at the foot of the dial circled once in four seconds, and each beat of the watch marked a quarter second.\" A regular watch sat in a circle at the top of the face.\n But the mechanics were a little funky. The first push of a button on the case's side would send both the center and seconds hands to zero. A second push launched the timer into action, but the third would stop the entire timepiece, including the regular clock.\n It didn't get much play. It wasn't until the early 20th century that the stopwatch gained any sort of popularity in the United States.\n A workplace trend brought to-the-second timekeeping into vogue. The popularity of scientific management-a theory that focused on labor productivity and efficient workflow-required precise measuring tools. The stopwatch was a favorite of the theory's developer, Frederick Taylor, who hovered over workers and timed their actions in order to break each movement into discrete chunks for analysis. Fun for management, not so much for the workers.\n Although the work theory was short-lived, the stopwatch persevered.\n By the 1970s, the timepiece got a major upgrade when time technology starting relying on quartz instead of mechanics. The regular vibrations of quartz in an electric circuit meant watches only fell out of time one second for every ten years, which upped the accuracy of precise moment to moment time-keeping.\n For both of their early achievements, Lexington the horse and the machine-made stopwatch that followed him wound up at the Smithsonian. But the city of Lexington, Kentucky recently took the record-holder back after a long lobby for the return of their namesake horse.\n \n Related Stories  The Invention and Evolution of the Drinking Straw, from Mint Juleps to Milkshakes\n\n The Director of Helvetica and Objectified Wants Your Help For His Third Film Urbanized\n\n Gifts for Design Lovers and Jon Ive Wannabees", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-11 20:30:00"}}, {"pk": 164, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:42:25", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830061/air-forces-experimental-hypersonic-aircraft-disappears-again", "wikiarticles": [3928108, 108145, 13726812, 25197709, 18595, 18895385, 102510, 108257, 764257], "title": "Air Force's Experimental Hypersonic Aircraft Disappears Again", "content": "Air Force\u2019s Experimental Hypersonic Aircraft Disappears Again\n  I don't know what the hell is going on with the Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle 2, but the Air Force just lost it again. Last year, the first Falcon vanished over the Pacific Ocean, leaving absolutely no trace. \n Now it has happened again. The Falcon HTV-2 launched today from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on top of a Minotaur IV Lite rocket.\n After successfully separating from the missile, the Falcon reoriented itself for reentry using its Reaction Control System. During the reentry, it used RCS and its aero controls to fly into Earth's upper atmosphere, passing to the pull-up phase, which put it in the correct altitude for the glide phase. In theory, during this phase the Falcon was going to test its aerodynamics and integrity flying at Mach 20, experiencing temperatures of 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014enough to melt steel.\n DARPA controllers at Vandenberg acquired signal from reentry to some time into the glide phase. At that point, only 36 minutes after launch, they lost telemetry contact never to get it back again. According to DARPA, the Falcon has automated self-destruction controls in case something goes wrong, but they still don't know what has happened. Two hours ago at the time of this writing they haven't followed up on their last Tweet.\n Back in April 2010, the first Falcon flew for nine minutes before DARPA experienced loss of signal.

That's actually fairly good as far as modern smartphones go. If you turn off the radios you can probably get 2+ days. John's Phone? It lasts up to THREE WEEKS between charges. Take that, iPhone! Winner: John's Phone\n Address Book\n The iPhone 4 has a whole application that is dedicated to contacts. You can store a gajillion of them with pictures and all their various info, and then you can use that info across the operating system. The address book on John's Phone is literally an address book. It's a small paper booklet attached to the back of the phone. It also has a small pen attached in the way that styluses are on smartphones, so you can jot down your friends' contact info. While I like the retro element, Winner: iPhone 4. You can just do a lot more with it.\n Making Calls\n John's Phone makes phone calls! The iPhone 4... Winner: John's Phone\n Screen\n The iPhone 4 made waves with its Retina Display that stomped everyone else in pixel density. It's very, very purty. John's Phone's tiny, two-color screen only displays incoming phone numbers, but I mean you can't see the pixels within those numbers even if you pressed your eyeball up to it! And what's the DPI of pen on paper? Oh, okay, fine. Winner: iPhone 4\n Dialing\n The iPhone 4's touchscreen is extremely responsive, and that makes dialing fairly easy. John's Phone, however, has big, raised bumps for number keys. You can quickly and easily dial blind-folded! 'nuff said. Winner: John's Phone\n Durability\n The iPhone 4 may be mostly metal, but its beautiful screen has been known to crack when dropped. John's Phone? It may be plastic, but it's so light that dropping it isn't going to do much, and there's just nothing really to break. Winner: John's Phone\n Price\n With a two-year contract you can get an iPhone 4 for about 200 bucks. If you go sans contract the full retail price is about $650. Ouch! John's Phone costs just $\u00a360 without a contract! Just pop in a SIM card and you're good to go. Winner: John's Phone (big time) [Correction: John's Phone is 60 POUNDS, not dollars. It's the equivalent of about $97. Yes, you caught my Yankifying it.]\n The Ultimate Winner\n Well, we've totaled everything up, weighted the points, dug deep, and our surprise winner is...\n It's the iPhone 4. Come on. Don't be stupid.\n John's Phone, however, is an awesome backup if you want something in case of emergencies or if you're going to be engaging in activities where phone-breakage is likely. You can grab it here for 60 bones [that's British bones].\n \n Related Stories  Nationwide 4G Showdown: Who's Fastest?\n\n The Best Way to Store Stuff in the Cloud\n\n The Best Streaming Music Service", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-11 18:00:00"}}, {"pk": 176, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:45:02", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5829620/kodak-all+in+one-printer-is-the-nearly-obsolete-deal-of-the-day", "wikiarticles": [50687, 1660427, 57627, 778233, 149644, 16315657, 2387156, 175859, 189512, 656589], "title": "Kodak All-In-One Printer Is the Nearly Obsolete Deal of the Day", "content": "What would Johannes Gutenberg think of the digitization of information?

That's why LAPTOP extensively tested the four major carriers in five cities nationwide\u2014using phones, USB modems, and mobile hotspots\u2014to determine which networks truly deliver on 4G's promise.\n How We Tested\n We conducted 4G testing in Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Orlando, and San Francisco. In three locations within each city, every product was tested to find out how quickly it loaded websites, and how fast it uploaded and downloaded files (using both real-world and synthetic tests). In each location, all tests for each carrier were performed during one sitting.\n We used Speedtest.net for our synthetic upload and download tests. We averaged 10 test results for each device in each location. To get real-world benchmarks, we downloaded a 155MB file (OpenOffice.org) from our FTP server. We also uploaded a 6.7MB Handbrake file to the same FTP. If it took more than 7 minutes to perform either of these tasks, it was counted as a failed attempt.\n The Results\n Speedtest.net Results Compared\n As you can see from the above results (click charts to embiggen), Verizon Wireless' 4G LTE network crushed the competition in the Speedtest.net app, a synthetic test that measures throughput. In our five cities nationwide across three devices Verizon averaged 12.3 Mbps down and 4.7 Mbps. T-Mobile turned in a solid 4.7 Mbps average download, but that's 2.6X less than Verizon.\n  Large File Download/Upload Speed Results Compared\n Verizon's lead wasn't nearly as pronounced in our large file download and upload tests. When pulling down a 155MB file from an FTP server, Verizon averaged 4.4 Mbps. That's 1.35 Mbps better than second-place T-Mobile. We also uploaded a 6.7 Mbps file to the same server, and Verizon finished 670 Kbps ahead of T-Mobile. Sprint and AT&T weren't even close.\n  Website Load Times Compared\n A few seconds here and there doesn't sound like a lot, but over the life of your device it definitely adds up. Verizon Wireless once again proved fastest in our Site Load Time test, averaging 10.18 seconds when loading popular sites on a 4G LTE phone and on a laptop connected to a 4G hotspot and with a 4G modem attached. T-Mobile turned in a good 12.59 seconds, followed by Sprint and AT&T.\n Verdict\n There's a reason why AT&T and (presumably) Sprint are moving to LTE. It's a superior technology. As a result, Verizon Wireless' 4G network consistently delivered better speeds than the other big three national carriers in our testing. We'd like to see less dropped connections and smoother 3G-4G hands-offs from Verizon's devices, but overall the provider offered much faster speeds. Although you'll pay more for Verizon's 4G phones versus competing carriers, to us the speed boost is worth the premium.\n If you're looking for a good 4G deal, consider buying a smartphone, connection card, or hotspot from T-Mobile. You'll pay $20 less per month versus Verizon for a phone, and you'll get very good speeds in more locations. Sprint's solid 4G download speeds earned it a third-place finish. While we appreciate the carrier's unlimited plans, the network wasn't very reliable. Not suprisingly, AT&T brought up the rear,because the carrier simply doesn't offer 4G speeds in many markets yet.\n Carrier By Carrier Results\n AT&T\n Sprint\n T-Mobile\n Verizon\n Related Links\n Top 8 Smartphones\n Verizon Wireless 4G MiFi 4510L Reviewed\n Sprint MiFi 3G/4G 4082 Mobile Hotspot Reviewed\n Laptopmag.com brings you in-depth reviews of the hottest mobile products, the latest tech news, helpful how-to advice, and expert analysis of the latest tech trends.\n \n Related Stories  iPhone 4 Vs The Simplest Phone on the Planet\n\n The Best Way to Store Stuff in the Cloud\n\n The Best Streaming Music Service", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-10 16:02:53"}}, {"pk": 167, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:43:11", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5829983/htc-buys-beats-all-your-bass-are-belong-to-them", "wikiarticles": [19644137, 14260687, 1275656, 1071803, 8083, 25755766, 14193166, 198584, 24855387, 19323800], "title": "HTC Buys Beats: All Your Bass Are Belong To Them", "content": "HTC Buys Beats: All Your Bass Are Belong To Them\n  HTC just shouted to the world that it has made a massive investment in Beats By Dre to the tune of $300M. Here's what it means for everyone involved\u2014especially you.\n What It Means for HTC\n For starters, the speakers on HTC phones and tablets are going to start sounding a lot better. Beats has been partnering with HP for a few years already, putting some suped-up audio into their laptops, and they sound pretty damn good (for being laptops). Essentially HTC is going to try to corner the mobile device audio market by having better speakers than anyone else\u2014an area where they're currently flailing. Their speakers have been pretty lousy at best, and Motorola has been blasting them off the soundstage. Now? Not so much.\n What It Means for Beats\n Well, it means they're going to have a lot more money to play with. More cash for R&D should translate to more innovation, if they spend it wisely. Beats, the brand, is owned by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, and they work with Monster to manufacture their branded hardware (headphones, speakers, etc). They'll continue to operate autonomously (so Monster will probably still be making the hardware unless they sink into hell), and they'll still be putting Beats into Chryslers cars and HP laptops. Beats will also enjoy greater exposure outside the audiophile world.\n What It Means For Dr. Dre\n $175 MILLION\n What It Means For You\n Starting this fall, HTC's devices will have way better tunes (honestly it'd be hard for them not to). As more and more people are using phones as their primary listening device, the mobile music race is really going to heat up. HTC just made a $300M bid to win it. Beats has proven that they can pack big sound into small spaces and if they can successfully do it at the smartphone level then HTC will likely set a new aural bar that the competition's going to have to try at least try to match.

And, because it's 2011, they're using technology to organize. Well, as much as a violent mob can be organized. But British Prime Minister David Cameron wants to cut them off. He's very, very wrong.\n And he's wrong for the exact same reason that the governments of Saudi Arabia and UAE were wrong a year ago. Cutting off the use of Twitter, Facebook, BBM, or any other digital means of discussion, is an infringement upon an entire society\u2014not just the destructive malcontents. Cameron's plan\u2014if you can even call it that\u2014would target individuals suspected of riot plotting, and then block their access to BBM and social networks. Somehow. How do you discern who's organizing riots, and who's just retweeting? Do you kick them off of the entire internet? Are they allowed back on? The extent to which this makes little sense and is technologically dubious is representative of Cameron's reasoning here. We balk when a Middle Eastern autocrat threatens to shutter BBM, but when the Prime Minister of a sophisticated, liberal society proposes the same thing, the western world gives him a chance to explain himself. Surely, there must be some rationale! We oughtn't be so fair.\n Cameron's motive is no less ignorant and diffident than any Saudi king\u2014he's afraid. Afraid of what the kids in the street are talking about on Twitter. And he's ignorant; ignorant because Twitter and BBM and all the rest aren't the cause of the unrest\u2014they're just a means. They're, like every other piece of technology, merely a tool. Parliamentary member Tom Watson called Cameron a \"Luddite,\" the FT notes, adding that \"technology is neutral.\"\n And he's mostly right. As the Financial Times points out, Twitter's been \"effective in organizing clean-up efforts and ad-hoc support for those affected by the rioting than it had been in bringing looters out onto the streets.\" A vague crackdown could inadvertently target people who are trying to mitigate, not advance, the rioting. Tech can be used for starting riots, or it can be used for fixing them. The window-smashing pedestrians didn't stumble upon Twitter and think, My God, we could use this to organize a bloody great riot! Their impetus to violence formed long before they tweeted.\n So if Cameron blocks BBM et al., affected rioters will just switch platforms. Lest he down all of Britain's access to the internet and jam its radio waves, the cause of all the youthful vitriol will bubble out of one digital teapot or another. Until the mob mentality can be dissolved, whether by reason, force, or both, no held-down off switch will end the burning.

The end lights up when I inhale, which I suppose is to make it more realistic (though it's also available in green and blue). But really, it just reminds me I'm smoking a very small vapo, not a cigarette. Also, it doesn't really taste like a real cigarette\u2014it's closer to hookah smoke or pipe tobacco sans the tobacco.

It's what separates Man from the animals, warming our hearts, fueling our engines, propelling our species to fates greater than our mammalian brethren. It's also just really neat to look at, as proven by these 79 Shooting Challenge entries.\n Winner - Need a Light?\n \nI was going to shoot this anyway, and then when I saw the fire challenge I thought it would be the perfect idea. I took over 200 pictures of the lighter, some without fire, some with a streak of flame, and some with the full flame. Shooting a composite also allowed me to have multiple lighting points with just one flash; lighting from the side allowed me to catch some of the detail in the wind guard, which would contrast with the smooth lighter body. I then stacked the pictures in photoshop, to create the composite and added a median filter to give it a 'too perfect' look. Shot with Canon 7D, ISO640, 60mm macro, f/6.3, Manual Focus, 1/80 for streaks, 1/20 for flame.\n -Matthew Taylor\n   Wyoming Forest Fire\n \nThere was a forest fire in Wyoming, close to where I am staying, so a friend and decided to go find a good place to shoot it. Here is a shot from the timelapse I did of the fire. 5D Mark II, 24mm f/1.4L II, 24mm @ ISO 1600, f/2.2, 12-Second Exposure\n -Eric Hines\n   Hot Wheels\n \nMy son and I were trying to come up with ideas for this week's challenge and our original plan was to soak a miniature car in gas and light it on fire while having a fan blow on it to appear like the car is moving on fire. Well, after trying for several hours to get that shot, we just abandoned that idea and grabbed the brake cleaner. We used an old mirror as the for the reflective surface with great results.\n -Chris McCready\n   Where There's Sparkler There's Fire\n \nThe shooting challenge this week was a good opportunity to use my new 105mm VRII Macro, what a lens! I was experimenting with taking pictures of flames, but eventually moved onto a sparkler I had bought recently. Nikon D90, 1/400 sec, f11, 105mm.\n -Nils Rohwer\n   Nonpareil Marble\n \nI was at a backyard BBQ last night, after a while we got a fire going and there was some kind of metal netting over the fire. I noticed that something interesting was happening to the flames as they came through it; I couldn't see what that thing actually was until I froze it in place with this photo. Nikon D2X, 24mm f/2 on non-full frame camera body = 36mm f/2 (actual), 1/1500, ISO 400\n -Will Christiansen\n   Spicy Dinner\n \nWith a post on Facebook I discovered that a couple friends of mine were fire eaters and breathers. My girlfriend and I met with them after dark and started snapping. Tag teaming this was the best picture I shot. Taken with our D90 with the 50mm lens f/1.8 with an exposure of 1/60.\n -Steven Unverzagt\n   Hot Wheels II\n \nWith this picture I wanted to accentuate the contour of a toy car by applying a wind tunnel-like method only with fire, to achieve this I used a simple lighter and sprayed it with an axe bottle, what made the fire extend.

It was shot with a Canon 60D, on a Manfrotto Tri-Pod with a 50mm Sigma 1:2.8 DG Macro...The Av was f:8 @ 1/500 sec. the ISO was 640, with a \u20131.3 Step. What I would have rather done was Burn something Really Really Big...But I live in a smallish town and they sort of frown on that sort of thing...\n -Charlie Carroll\n   Minecraft\n \nWhen I saw the idea of fire for the next photo challenge the first thing that popped into my head was the torches from Minecraft. I recently bought the game and ended up playing it for three days straight. I only stopped for fear of blood clots.\n I made most of the blocks from papercraft patterns I found online. I had to make the torch paper model by hand in photoshop, making sure to give each pixel the right color by color sampling from screenshots. I also had a hard time making sure that the torch was proportional to the blocks, and I couldn't get quite the right angle.\n I inserted a birthday candle into the paper torch and lit it up. I was able to take 4 photographs before the blocks burst into flames. This shot is the first one. The only editing done to this photo was an automatic adjustment to the white balance in adobe camera raw, and then resizing in photoshop.\n Even though this photo contains things from Minecraft, I figure it is still within your contest rules because I actually got the block patterns from a third party site and Minecraft really only seems concerned with people stealing the software, not using Minecraft textures to make fun photos.

I knew I wanted to try to capture that on capera for this week's shooting challenge. I used an old empty bottle of wine that I had lying around and fueled the flames with Jack Daniel's vapors. Canon 10D. Shutter speed 0\"3 f/6.7 iso 1600\n -Will Aisenberg\n   Firebolt\n \nI was grilling with some friends and put a few too many coals on the bbq. Well, I happened to get an HTC thunderbolt recently and love the camera. So I decided to play with it and take some shots of the flames pouring out of the grill. I think it's pretty damn impressive for a cellphone camera. Only lost a few arm hairs in the making of this shot!

They lack a reason to exist. The myTouch 4G Slide has one, though: to be the best cameraphone you can buy.\n Why It Matters\n The cameras in your average smartphone today are, by and large, pretty okay. But they're generally not good enough to replace a cheap point-and-shoot. The white balance sucks, the color saturation's off, the low-light performance is crummy, whatever. There have been a few exceptions so far: phones from Nokia, some from Sony Ericsson, and the iPhone 4. And it's really the latter that made a killer camera bolted to a phone a mainstream thing, putting one in the pockets of tens millions of people. The myTouch 4G Slide is the first Android phone to make a concerted effort to do that, with an 8-megapixel backside-illuminated CMOS sensor that's exclusive to the Slide for now, and not unlike what we'll probably see in the next iPhone.\n Using It\n Beyond the camera, the myTouch 4G Slide is a totally typical, but totally fine Android phone. It's running Android 2.3 with HTC Sense on top, and it's got a very good keyboard. No surprises. But let's talk about the camera. HTC tries to make it feel very point-and-shooty, with deeper controls than your average phone's camera, for everything from white balance to ISO and exposure. There's also a ton of filters built in, to scratch your Instagram itch. \"Zero-shutter lag\" means it's effectively taking pictures before you press the shutter button, so once the camera app's open, you shouldn't miss anything. The features aren't quite as extensive as a full-blown camera, but it's close enough with perks like face detection, at least for most people.\n \n Like\n It's fast with a 1.2GHz dual-core chip, even with HTC's custom software running on top. The keyboard is huge and clicky. HTC still delivers some of the best materials this side of the iPhone 4\u2014the phone just feels like quality. T-Mobile is fast when it's fast\u2014I was peaking around 7-8Mbps around Georgia. Built-in Netflix, still a relative rarity for Android. The camera is legitimately good. It's quick to shoot; the colors are more accurate, the 1080p video more detailed than the iPhone 4; and the software delivers most of the control an average-but-concerned shooter would want.\n Check out full-sized samples here.\n No Like\n HTC's Sense skin looks terribly 2008 at this point. The low-quality gradients, and weird smatterings of glossy gloss. The faux 3D desktop is gauche. It doesn't make Android any better. T-Mobile in New York isn't fast at all\u2014the best downstream speed I ever saw was around 3Mbps. I wish the shutter button was more useful. Because of the way the phone splits, trying to use the shutter button resulted in camera shake like 80 percent of the time. And obviously a slider phone is kinda chunky.\n \n Should I Buy This?\n If you're on T-Mobile and having a solid camera built into your phone is a serious priority, well, it's kind of a no-brainer\u2014if you don't mind the added heft or Android, which could be two serious downers, depending on who you are.\n \n Specs\n myTouch 4G Slide\n Network: T-Mobile\n Screen: 3.7-inch, 800x480 resolution\n Weight: 6.5oz\n Processor and RAM: 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon, 768MB\n Camera: 8-megapixel stills, 1080p video (rear);\n Storage: 4GB internal + up to 32GB SD Storage\n OS: Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) + Custom Skin\n Battery: 1540 mAh\n Price: $200 with two-year contract", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-09 18:00:00"}}, {"pk": 212, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-16 09:20:34", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5831107/you-may-get-to-see-space-from-a-balloon-by-the-middle-of-the-decade", "wikiarticles": [], "title": "You May Get to See Space From a Balloon by the Middle of the Decade", "content": "You May Get to See Space From a Balloon by the Middle of the Decade\n   You may get to see space in just three or four years using a balloon. And, unlike SpaceShipTwo, you'll be able to be up there for a couple of hours instead of just a few minutes. \n The ticket price will also be less expensive than Virgin Galactic's rocket plane, but not that much. While a trip in SpaceShipTwo will be a whooping $200,000, in Bloon\u2014the name of this aircraft\u2014you will have to pay a sightly-less-whooping $156,000 seat. The differences don't end there: SpaceShipTwo will get you up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) while Bloon will only reach 36 kilometers (22 miles). That also means that you will not be able to experience zero gravity, unlike with Virgin Galactic's wonderplane.\n You will, however, see the curvature of Earth and its atmosphere for about two hours. An experience that people have seen before on other balloons, according to zero2infinity's founder and CEO Jos\u00e9 Mariano L\u00f3pez-Urdiales:\n  The first people who described the earth as a blue ball were not in rockets. They were flying in balloons. [...] A balloon stays for a longer time than a ballistic parabola. A suborbital vehicle is limited by the laws of ballistics and only lasts a few minutes. It can only last so long where the sky is black and the view is beautiful.\n  I'm sure it would be absolutely amazing but... well, it just will not be the thrill of getting to cruise altitude on WhiteKnightTwo and then experiencing the rocket firing up at full throttle inside SpaceShipTwo until you reach sub-orbital altitude.\n L\u00f3pez-Urdiales had this idea a long time ago, after working for the European Space Agency and Boeing, but the company just completed their first round of funding from one of Spain's most important banks. That's good, because that means they seem to be on their way to achieve their objectives. And the more people that compete in this arena, the cheaper it will get. Faster too.\n Would you pay $44,000 extra to get up to 100 kilometers in a rocket-plane like SpaceShipTwo and experience zero gravity for a few minutes? Or would you rather pay just the $156,000 to see Earth's curvature, its atmosphere and the blackness of space from 36 kilometers?
