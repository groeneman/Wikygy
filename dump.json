redacted document about the AT&T-Mobile merger was oh-so-briefly posted on the FCC's site by Arnold & Porter LLP, a law firm working on the deal for AT&T. Outlining some of AT&T's confidential LTE plans, it was quickly taken down. Well, here it is. \n The document essentially lays out AT&T's plans for its 4G LTE rollout with a lot of very specific numbers squeezed in between the helpful bumpers [Begin Confidential Information] and [End Confidential Information].\n The gist: Under AT&T's current one-year accelerated plan, it's going to cover 70 million Americans by the end of this year, 170 million by the end of next, 250 million by the end of 2013. And they're going to do that by upgrading 44,000 nodes to LTE: 8,000 this year, 16,000 next year, and 20,000 in 2013. The 97 percent of Americans they're promising to cover if the T-Mobile merger goes through?

Seems like everyone does. Cable television routinely scores lower in customer satisfaction than just about anything else\u2014including congress. So why don't you just switch providers? Oh yeah, you can't. You're so screwed!\n The sad truth is, most Americans don't have a choice of cable providers. Sure, there are a lot of cable companies out there, but odds are there's only one you can use. While no one cable company dominates the nation, there are a lot of regional cable fiefdoms. Live in San Francisco? It's Comcast for you. Atlanta? Cox. New York City? Time Warner. That matters because it translates into high prices and crummy service.\n Nationally speaking, there's plenty of competition. But locally, that's just not true. For the overwhelming majority of us it's the local cable-opoly, or get bent. Which means we pay exorbitant bills, suffer four hour install time windows, and just suck it up when our cable provider throttles our download speeds or caps our bandwidth.\n The only way this changes is with competition. When a competing cable company is present, your cable bill typically goes down by 15-percent, and service generally improves. But almost nobody has a competing cable company.\n Simply put, you're paying way too much for Nickelodeon.\n The cable industry is a patchwork of micro-monopolies. Or more accurately, natural monopolies: situations of little or no competition that doesn't break enough laws to get regulated. A natural monopoly occurs when it's so expensive to enter a market that it doesn't make sense for a competitors to come in. With cable TV, there's a massive fixed cost to enter a new market\u2014putting in new cable lines. So, basically, whoever showed up first\u2014or the company that bought them\u2014has the legacy right of being the local cable company.\n For decades, cable operators were allowed to set up exclusive regional franchises. A cable company would come into an area, and more or less tell the municipal area in charge of franchising that it needed an exclusive for the next, say, 12-15 years if it was going to build out lines. That ended in 1992 with the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, but the damage was done.\n Cable companies had already divided up the nation like Europe colonizing Africa. By the time regulation arrived, the land grab was already over.\n The last reliable statistic shows that a mere 2-percent of American markets had a choice of cable providers. That's from 2003, the last time the FCC produced a statistic. (At least that they could supply us with.) You may be surprised to learn that the FCC doesn't have anything to do with cable franchising. Nor does the FTC. An FTC spokesman told Gizmodo that \"we don't look at industries considered common carriers, like airlines, phone companies and utilities.\"\n Throughout most of cable's history, it's been regulated at the local level. Counties and cities were the agencies responsible for allowing cable franchises. That is changing, slightly. More than 20 states now have franchise authority, due largely to intensive lobbying by telcos like Verizon and AT&T.\n You know you're fucked when you're relying on AT&T to make things better.\n Ultimately, this patchwork of local regulation means cable companies themselves are often more powerful than the body overseeing them. And as long as none of the micro-monopolies grows too large nationally, it can continue to control the local weather.\n But what about those second cable companies that some people have? They're typically overbuilders, a company that builds new lines in an area where one cable company already exists. They tend to be quite small. The best known, for example, is probably WideOpenWest Networks, or WOW. WOW has just 410,000 subscribers. And that's because it's really, really hard for a second company to come into an existing market.\n While everyone has a right to access the poles, the same isn't true of the wires that hang from them. In short, if you're an upstart cable company coming into a new area, you have to run your own lines. It's very expensive, and it also means you can easily be crushed by the existing monopoly.\n One cable industry insider, who would only speak on background, explained how it works:\n First you have to overcome a mishmash of local regulations. You have to get a permit to come in, which can be a legal hassle, with a wait time of many months just to get approval. Then its time to build.\n To build a new network and make it price-competitive, you have to reach 100-percent of customers in that area. Which means building an extensive network of lines, all the way to the door. If you're very lucky you may capture 10 to 20-percent of the market. You do that by offering steep discounts on bundled services. This gets you new customers, but at a loss.\n Then, Comcast, or Cablevision, or Time Warner\u2014or whichever provider is dominant in the area\u2014comes along behind you with sweetheart deals for any of its customers who were leaving. They offer discounted packages and teaser rates. Poof. They're gone. That's five percent of the market. Now you've spent a fortune on new lines and infrastructure, for very few new customers.\n So there's very little financial incentive for a competitor to try to build. It's just too damn hard to build a customer base. To do that, you need to be a giant company to begin with. Like, say, a telco.\n If you're lucky, you may have the option for Verizon FiOS or AT&T U-Verse. But probably not. Verizon only passes (cable lingo for is available at) 15 million premises nationwide, and has just 3.7 million video subscribers. AT&T is even smaller, at 3.2 million. Comcast, by comparison, has 22 million video subscribers.\n What's more, there's no evidence that telcos are having a positive effect on pricing. In fact, in some areas where AT&T managed to get the laws changed, like Michigan, prices have gone up.\n But wait! What about satellite? Doesn't satellite fix everything? No.\n According to the Government Accountability Office, satellite services have little-to-no effect on cable prices. (And besides, satellite service is terrible. Who doesn't want to watch TV when it's overcast outside?)\n Ultimately what all of this means is that consumers are left with little recourse. Because there's plenty of competition nationally, nobody is looking out for you locally.\n Except us.\n All this week, Gizmodo is going to take a long-hard look at the cable industry, and how to improve it.

We listened in and got a little rare insight into how the Nexus program works.\n When your kid asks you, \"Mommy, where do Nexuses come from?\" now you'll have an answer.\n The Nexus program is what Google uses to raise the bar for hardware manufacturers. It's gotta run the latest and greatest version of Android, and it's gotta run it well. Every year around Christmas time, Google picks a hardware manufacturer to make the next Nexus phone. They then have about nine months to build it. Interesting. We knew that Google works closely with whomever is building their next Nexus, but it sounds like Google is calling the shots even more than we thought. It would appear that they say what they need, and then manufacturers climb over each other and bid to build the thing.\n You might be wondering if Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility will give Motorola a leg up. Google says no, they will have to bid to build it just like everyone else. Hooray for competition!\n On the call there was also a lot of mention of in-home devices, which was a surprise since the purchase was for Motorola Mobility (Moto's mobile devision), specifically. Motorola's CEO Sanjay Jha said, \"There is a great convergence between the mobile world and the content that enters the home through the set top boxes.\" Could this mean Motorola will play a key role in the evolution of Google TV? Time will tell.\n You might wonder why Google just blew $12.5 bil on Motorola if they aren't going to be the next Nexus factory. The answer lies not only in the 17,000+ patents Motorola already owns, but also in the thousands more that Moto has \"in-process.\" Google wouldn't say exactly how they'll leverage those against the many lawsuits that have been leveled against them, but they did say that they feel this acquisition will better protect them.\n So, will the next next Nexus be made by Moto? Well, the last rumors still point to Samsung, which would make two in a row for the big S, following last year's Nexus S, but you know how these rumors go, and there may yet be a Moto surprise for us all.\n  You can keep up with Brent Rose, the author of this post, on Google+ or Twitter. \n Related Stories  The Most Interesting Tablet You've Never Heard Of\n\n Why Does This Phone Have a License Plate?\n\n Firefox 6 Is Out Ahead of Schedule", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-15 15:40:27"}}, {"pk": 149, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:37:55", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830842/google-is-buying-motorola", "wikiarticles": [1275656, 30332078, 3144730, 20319, 468431, 1092923, 24855387, 12610483, 14260687], "title": "Google Is Buying Motorola", "content": "Google Is Buying Motorola\n  Crazy news just in\u2014Google is acquiring the handset division of Motorola, Motorola Mobility, for $12.5 billion. This means Google could soon officially in the hardware business.\n Could, because the deal has to pass regulatory scrutiny from governments around the world plus the eyeballs of Motorola's shareholders. But should that all clear, this is a big, big deal. From the press release (below), \"the acquisition of Motorola Mobility, a dedicated Android partner, will enable Google to supercharge the Android ecosystem and will enhance competition in mobile computing. Motorola Mobility will remain a licensee of Android and Android will remain open.

That said, despite offering 32 phones\u201421 of which have Android baked in\u2014Nasdaq pegged Motorola with a paltry 3% market share as of the beginning of this year. Not exactly a commanding force. Then again, that was before Google was at the reins.\n Some additional thoughts:\n \u2022 Google putting out its own hardware makes things super awkward for Google's Android partners, and could be the best thing that ever happened to Windows Phone. Samsung, HTC, et al, are going to need another avenue of attack, since Motorola branded products are going to theoretically have a major advantage, even if Google insists they're going to have to compete like every other phonemaker.\n \u2022 What does this mean for Google's retail skills? They totally boned the original Nexus launch. On the one hand, now they've got Motorola's supply chain and competencies. On the other hand, Motorola lately hasn't been all that amazing (3 percent share, and that's with the most visible Android brand name on the market).\n \u2022 Motorola's got something like 21 Android handsets. Does that mean we're suddenly going to have two dozen phones running stock Android? That would be kind of incredible. At the same time, other OEMs are probably going to be even more aggressive with their skins so that they can \"differentiate.\" In an ideal world, they're forced to find a way to actually improve the Android experience. In reality, they're probably just going to screw it up more.\n [Businesswire and TNW]\n Update: A blog post on Google's official blog states that part of the attraction for Google was Motorola's generous (17,000) handful of patents, with CEO Larry Page writing:\n  \"We recently explained how companies including Microsoft and Apple are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on Android. The U.S. Department of Justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to \"protect competition and innovation in the open source software community\" and it is currently looking into the results of the Nortel auction. Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies.\"\n  Just in case you had little doubt in your mind, patents are the new basketball cards.\n  MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. & LIBERTYVILLE, Ill., Aug 15, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) \u2014 Google Inc. GOOG -3.15% and Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. MMI +60.36% today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Google will acquire Motorola Mobility for $40.00 per share in cash, or a total of about $12.5 billion, a premium of 63% to the closing price of Motorola Mobility shares on Friday, August 12, 2011. The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies.\n The acquisition of Motorola Mobility, a dedicated Android partner, will enable Google to supercharge the Android ecosystem and will enhance competition in mobile computing.

Google will run Motorola Mobility as a separate business.\n Larry Page, CEO of Google, said, \"Motorola Mobility's total commitment to Android has created a natural fit for our two companies. Together, we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the entire Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and developers. I look forward to welcoming Motorolans to our family of Googlers.\"\n Sanjay Jha, CEO of Motorola Mobility, said, \"This transaction offers significant value for Motorola Mobility's stockholders and provides compelling new opportunities for our employees, customers, and partners around the world. We have shared a productive partnership with Google to advance the Android platform, and now through this combination we will be able to do even more to innovate and deliver outstanding mobility solutions across our mobile devices and home businesses.\"\n Andy Rubin, Senior Vice President of Mobile at Google, said, \"We expect that this combination will enable us to break new ground for the Android ecosystem. However, our vision for Android is unchanged and Google remains firmly committed to Android as an open platform and a vibrant open source community. We will continue to work with all of our valued Android partners to develop and distribute innovative Android-powered devices.\"\n The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals in the US, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and the approval of Motorola Mobility's stockholders.

Privately, I don't care if it's your birthday. I secretly hate you. But society now forces me to acknowledge your virtual existence. \n So, if you're anything like me\u2014admit it\u2014you feel like a willful prisoner of the accepted technologies of the day. It's not just about keeping track of the people you don't truly care about. That's one thing. It's that there are \"close friends\" in your life that you don't give two shits about, but still have to RSVP to their asinine Facebook events or @reply them on Twitter. Close only because you share a few too many drunken pictures together.\n But, for one reason or another, you can't break the friendship. Breaking up is hard to do, be it for complicated group associations or having to see them everyday. So what can you do? Lie. And lie well.\n Be as Passive Aggressive as Possible\n Let's face it. If you were one of those \"I say what I mean when I mean it\" types, you wouldn't have this problem. That kind of honesty sucks. Hell, the only reason I write this now is because the people in my life that this applies to don't read Gizmodo\u2014if you do, you're safe. You can trust me. So, the only feasible way to go about keeping friends off your back is by keeping them at a distance while making it seem like you care.\n That means you can't go off grid. You can't just turn off your accounts, because A) The friends you actually care about are still there, and B) Having more friends/followers is cool. Don't be stupid and risk losing your friend count. And for all you know, your actual friends hate you and are playing this exact game with you. You're stuck.\n Know What You Use\n I barely use my Tumblr these days. I don't worry too much about what's happening on LinkedIn, though I'll be sure to change some of my settings ASAP. Really, my social networks of choice are Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Foursquare, and Google+. In that order. So my behavior in these spaces naturally informs how and when I lie. You need to know what you habitually use and how they connect before you can be an effective liar. Otherwise, you'll get caught or stuck going to a party or baby shower you don't want to be seen at.\n Also keep in mind that a lot of the services you use will, by design, try to keep you honest. Not because they esteem honesty as to shun those who break the 8th/9th Commandment. Rather, telling the truth is just easier. For a computer. You, on the other hand, are human. You should celebrate that fact. Therefore!\n Be Creative... Within Reason\n Scenario. A few of your friends have invited you to hang out for old times' sake. You haven't seen them in some time, and it really would be nice to catch up. Only they live across state lines, and your last bender has left you a little broke.\n Simple solution right? Just tell them you can't come out. You're all adults. They'll understand. Except you let things get to the last minute, and if you flake you look like a bastard. Considerably more complicated. Now what? Well, you could start with a few well-placed tweets or status updates, like \"Ugh I feel awful\" or \"I can't believe this happened!\" +1 an article on WebMD. Instagram a sad puppy. All stuff that's specific enough to catch their eye but vague enough as to not feel forced. Later, when you have that talk to break plans, you'll likely hear, \"Yeah I saw your [insert here]. Everything ok?\" Perfect.\n Take it a step further. Say you opt with the \"My dog died\" range of excuses. Like saying your father got into a car accident and you need to rush to his side. Don't check into the hospital on Foursquare. It's classless, hurts your credibility, and you won't get points for it. Instead, a few choice tweets from the trip here and there is enough to get some sympathy and good will. But be careful! Never overdo it. Short of paying people off, you don't wanna wind up having no one to corroborate your story.\n Always Have a Plan\n Ultimately, this is a numbers game. The law of averages has it that you're gonna screw up somehow and get caught in a lie. Now, if it's little enough you can talk your way out of it, provided you come prepared. It's just like how in Catholic school they teach that lies only beget more lies. That's not so terrible if you know what you're doing.\n Now, you just stood up a date, telling him you have to do some work. But they just busted you. It wasn't hard. You just tweeted how great a time you're having at the party you ditched him for. You even checked in at the location. Been there, done that. All you have to do is send a picture of yourself doing something domestic. A picture you smartly took of yourself beforehand. Then sober up the best you can, and make a phone call from a quiet place to allay any suspicions. Tell him you were making gentle fun of the friend who's party you're at right now. She never even invited you, but you found out on Facebook anyway. The bitch. It sounds ridiculous\u2014it is\u2014but by now you've got him laughing. Good. While it's not the most airtight of solutions, it sows enough reasonable doubt to get you out of hot water.\n However, if it's a big enough lie...\n Be Prepared to Confess\n Well, you can't win 'em all. Sometimes you get caught, and you have to keep it real. This is a good thing. Friendship should not be taken lightly, and lying is wrong. But most importantly, getting caught keeps your sharp for next time. So be ready for it, because it's gonna happen eventually. Don't be afraid to beg for forgiveness. It may not come lightly. It may not come at all. If it does, good for you. You keep a friend, and maybe you can begrudge them a little more respect. If not, who needs them? Either way, lesson learned.\n And remember...\n You Are Not a Sociopath\n You're just a victim of circumstance. There's no reason you shouldn't use your know-how to get out of a tight spot, and you'll probably need that know-how more these days. The ubiquity of all things social network-y means that you'll find yourself in all sorts of situations that demand you deal with people's bullshit. And people's bullshit can overlap and overwhelm in surprising and uncomfortable ways. No one has 900 friends in real life. At the same time, having even 50 regular friends bombarding you with their lives and plans can be very stressful. This is about survival. I'll concede that honesty is still the best policy. But, even for the most noble among you, a good lie can be an excellent back-up.\n  You can keep up with Kwame Opam, the author of this post, on Twitter, Facebook, and occasionally Google+. \n Related Stories  How to Break Your Daily Caffeine Habit and Use Coffee Strategically\n\n How to Take a Gorgeous Photo Like This on a Perfect Summer Night\n\n How To Remove Your Personal Information From Background Check Websites", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-13 17:00:00"}}, {"pk": 153, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:39:34", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830488/facebook-messenger-cocktails-super-8-cams-panoramic-pictures-and-more", "wikiarticles": [16115172, 28030496, 19194005, 19471135, 30126723, 7529378, 24855387, 12610483], "title": "Facebook Messenger, Cocktails, Super 8 Cams, Panoramic Pictures and More", "content": "See the rest of this week's best iPhone apps  The week's best Android apps\n \nPano: It's a panoramic picture taking app for your Android phone.

They're stunning, every bit as good as anything shot with a DSLR. And that's because they are shot with a DSLR. Which sucks.\n If you aren't familiar with it, Instagram is a social networking and camera tool that lives entirely in an iPhone app. You take pictures, apply filters (or not) and share them on Instagram, which can also pipe them to Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, Tumblr and a variety of other social networks.\n Instagram does not have a web-upload option. It barely has a website. It's entirely mobile, and photos can only be sought-out through the app. Sure, each photo generates its own URL, but you can only get that URL if the photo is posted on another service like Facebook. And that's kind of the beauty of the whole thing. It celebrates our increasingly mobile culture. It tags along with your friends everywhere they go, tucked away in their blue jeans and messenger bags. Occasionally, they pull it out of their pockets, and share what they're seeing. And suddenly there you are, with them, connected to one another through a piece of hardware descended from a technology that was created specifically to connect people. I can't be the only one who finds that wonderful.\n There is obviously no right way to Instagram. You use it for what you use it for. But certainly it's a social network that tracks what's going on now. When describing Instagram to friends who haven't used it, I don't talk about the filters, or the quality of the photos, I talk about how it lets me see what my friends are doing right now.\n It is the quicker Flickr; a visual Twitter.\n And so when you post photos from yesterday, or last week, or even a few hours ago that you took with your standalone camera, imported to your computer, processed with an app, and then synced back to your phone, you're slowing it down. Breaking the flow. It's not wrong, per se, but it violates the spirit of the app.\n It is, after all, Instagram, not Latergram.\n There are a lot of places to showcase great photography online. Flickr, Picassa, Smugmug. I fully expect to see lots of awesome, highly processed shots of Fireworks on those sites on July 5 and July 6 and, Hell, even July 10. But on Instagram if I'm seeing fireworks shots a day or two later it's a little jarring. Moreover, if everyone starts using it the way my friend does, it's going to kill it. Instead of a window, it will become an archive.\n And to be clear, this has nothing to do with the gamification features on Instagram. Sure, everybody loves to get their own little hearts and stars. But who cares how many likes somebody else's stuff gets? Ultimately, it's not about that.\n I don't care how many hearts my buddy gets; I'd just prefer to see where he is today instead of where he was yesterday.\n  You can keep up with Mat Honan, the author of this post, on Twitter, Facebook, or Google+. \n Related Stories  Talking With Your Earbuds in: Rude or Not Rude?\n\n When Chat Attacks: How To Instant Message Without Wasting Your Day or Being a Jerk\n\n Rdio-Rolling: The Best New Way to Punk Your Friends", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-12 20:00:00"}}, {"pk": 156, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:40:30", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830424/nerf-n+strike-deploy-cs+6-is-the-office-warfare-deal-of-the-day", "wikiarticles": [45876, 988689, 19682791, 18711859, 5522248, 157299, 838392, 28340860, 25352629, 27722419], "title": "Nerf N-Strike Deploy CS-6 Is the Office Warfare Deal of the Day", "content": "I'd describe myself as a pretty peaceful guy.

It became so addictive that I exchanged it for an iPod touch. Now I'm shopping for a new addiction. \n Although we had our good times, I eventually came to feel that I was losing something of myself in the pairing. The device was there with me in social situations and solitary ones, making each moment more informative but also less rich. I found it hard to create good boundaries - especially because out of the two of us, I was the only one trying. Mostly, the iPhone was depriving me of quiet mind space. Gone were all the many once-taken-for-granted in between moments where I would mentally process my day or just stare into space.\n Instead, those minutes became full of tasks: catch up on Words With Friends, scroll through Facebook. I was rewarded by little bursts of dopamine, delivered at a variable rate that kept me coming back like a senior at the slots. I felt little embarrassment about my ties to this thing, if only because most people I know were in the throes of a similar relationship. On subways, on street corners, on road trips, at restaurants, I sometimes looked up and all around me saw everyone else looking down. I felt sad for all these people absorbed in their machines, missing out on the parts of life that operate without cell reception. But then I'd point my head right back down.\n iPhone cold turkey\n I didn't go cold turkey: when I gave away the iPhone, I replaced it with an iPod Touch. It's the methadone to the iPhone's heroin. The Touch has a lot of the useful stuff that I like about the iPhone, but it can only access email or texts or Facebook when there's an unlocked wireless Internet.\n What peace this little device has ferried into my psyche! Turn off the Internet, and the whole world feels like Walden Pond.\n Like Thoreau, I went to the woods of our technological landscape:\n  because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived\u2026I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.\n  However, I found that digital solitude could translate into real-world loneliness: At dinner parties, everyone else was bowing at the table with the blue light glowing on their faces. A couple times, I pulled out a book-reading being a habit about which I'm happy to be compulsive. But it took me out of the situations almost as much as my iPhone had. Hoping for a way to stay engaged while also keeping my hands from fidgeting during those awkward social moments where I'm the only person not plugged into the grand switchboard, I decided to explore the virtues of cigarettes.\n Addictions tend to be fungible. Switching seats on the Titanic, I've heard it called. According to TechCrunch, technology is the new smoking. Alexis Tsotsis' recent post references a new British study that says that a study found 53 percent of its participants felt \"upset\" after a mandated day off the web; 40 percent felt \"lonely.\" Many compared it to quitting smoking.\n Why smoking is better than the smartphone\n I've yet to take up the habit, but I've started to consider some of the reasons why smoking might just be better for me than using a smartphone (if smoking wouldn't kill you and caused all kind of bad things):\n \u2022 Cigarettes could help me better interact with people. I can carry on a conversation while smoking. I'd be forced to occasionally interact with others. \"Excuse me, do you have a light?\" I'm guessing more love connections have been made with those words than through OKCupid. Though maybe not for much longer.\n \u2022 Activities that are easier to do with a cigarette than with an iPhone: Walk without tripping, talk on the phone, bicycle, stare into the sky.\n \u2022 They have monetary value, and I think this makes one more accountable. Most smokers I know have a pretty good idea of how much they smoke in a given week, and how much they spend. I have no idea how much iPhone time I was logging with my unlimited data plan. If I'd had to pay per minute, I would've at least made an attempt to budget my usage.\n \u2022 Cigarettes take a fixed amount of time to smoke. They're distractions with built in timers. Smoking allows the perfect amount of time for a break. The \"breaks\" I've taken to use an iPhone usually go on longer than planned and leave me more mentally exhausted than when I started.\n \u2022 If you smoke, at least you're a smoker. You can say \"I have to go smoke\" and people understand that you have an addiction you have to feed. You're hooked. But you're not necessarily an asshole. Not so if you must excuse yourself from a baby shower because you need to check Instagram.\n \u2022 Smoking is obvious. Someone can see you're smoking. Afterwards, you smell like you were smoking. It's hard to hide. But when my accountant stops mid-sentence to look at his device, how do I know what kind of Facebook message I'm competing with?\n \u2022 You can live off the grid and the cancer sticks still work. Anonymous can't steal your nicotine password, and Apple can't use your cigarette's GPS to track you. Your Marlboro never demands you download an update.\n \u2022 When a pack of cigarettes falls into the toilet, you don't have to fish them out, dry them off and pray. Although you can if you want. Leave your Parliaments at a beer garden? Totally not a big deal.\n When you're using tobacco, you are supporting a company that is at least somewhat straightforward regarding the harmful nature of their products. No warning labels on the iPhone. In fact, people are giving them to their kids and using them in cars.\n \u2022 It's too early to come to any firm conclusion regarding the health effects of using cell phones. Illnesses caused by smoking, on the other hand, are well understood. There's a richer library of information on the effects of cigarettes. I'm thinking there's a better chance at helping people suffering from smoking-related maladies than to aid those dealing with unknown monsters like phone-induced brain cancer or Angry Birds Addiction.\n \u2022 Cigarettes are less taxing on your hands. I didn't even realize how much my thumbs were hurting from many months of iPhone emailing and texting until I gave up the habit.\n \u2022 It is way sexier to light up a cigarette after sex then to light up a smart phone. Especially when there is a passcode involved.\n I know more people who have successfully given up cigarettes than have given up using a smart phone.\n Aesthetically, I prefer the cigarette to the iPhone. There's a uniformity to people's digital habits that I find troublesome. The devices all look pretty much the same, and most of the people I know do not have writerly email flourishes they use, or wildly distinctive looking websites, or texting habits that differentiate them greatly from all the other people in my contacts. Every text conversation looks alike. I'm left longing for the kind of differentiation one finds among smokers. My friend Christa only smokes Nat Sherman's, which are charming in their brownness as they sit on her lips. Marie keeps her Marlboro Lights deep in between her ring and middle fingers, wrapping the rest of her hand around her face while she drags in. And the smell of Camels, unfiltered, forever will remind me of my father.\n Lately, however, he smells less smokey. Doctors orders, he's given it up. I don't know if it's just a coincidence that this event has neatly dovetailed with the acquisition of his very first cell phone. He sings its praises. It even has an address book in it, he tells me. Two weeks after getting it, it fell into the toilet. I asked him how he felt.\n \"Completely bereft.\"\n  Anna Jane Grossman is a New York writer.

[YouTube via Business Insider and Village Voice]\n Update: Sources we've spoken to inside Anonymous' IRC have cast some heavy, heavy doubt upon the legitimacy of #OpFacebook. Unlike Anonymous' major offensives, which have the blessing of the collective's prominent operators, the Facebook takedown is more of a splinter maneuver. \"#OPFacebook is not endorsed by Anonops at this time,\" stated one member. The generally-reputable AnonOps Twitter feed confirms as much. Another IRC member put it more clearly:\n  Anonymous is a mindset not a group. Mindsets do not have leaders. With any given operation there are always some who agree and some who disagree. With opFaceBook specifically there are those that agree and those that disagree. Annoymous allows each person individually to vote on each operation, a yes vote means they participate, a no vote means they do not. Anyone is allowed to create an op and if others vote yes it will get traction and something may be accomplished.\n  Essentially, this is a turkey without a head. It's possible some members of Anonymous may try to attack Facebook, but without the blessing and organization of Anonymous' chief operators, it's doubtful Facebook will be scratched, much less destroyed. Especially with months of forewarning.\n  You can keep up with Kelly Hodgkins, the author of this post, on Twitter, Google + or Facebook. Update 2: A fellow claiming to be the originator of #OpFacebook says the whole thing was a terrible mistake and misunderstanding. In brief, the original plan to punish Facebook for user data storage spun out of his control, fanned by impetuous groupies, misleading media reports, and a total lack of organization. Sounds about right.

Right now, Exxon is still number one at 352.9 billion compared to Apple's 346.74 billion.\n But even if Apple's stock market capitalization were actually higher than Exxon's, would it be a more valuable company? The answer is probably no. \n The rise of Apple\n It's amazing that a company like Apple has been able to reach a giant like ExxonMobil in market capitalization. A couple decades ago it was just an overpriced beige box manufacturer with an obsolete operating system. I remember because I was a Mac fanboy then, when everyone was using Windows and Michael Dell said that the company should be sold as scrap and the money returned to its shareholders.\n Then Steve came back.\n After the iPod, Mac OS X, the iPhone, and iPad, Apple has become the number one technology company in the world. Bar none. There's no company with better style, design sense, attention to detail, marketing and manufacturing precision. Apple is the best, and that's why most consumers crave its products. That's why the rest of the industry follows Cupertino too, even into entirely new markets.\n It was Steve Jobs' unique vision and his strict command of a brilliant troop of engineers that made\u2014and still makes\u2014it all possible. Together, they created the future. Now Apple is the new Microsoft, and they control it all\u2014from the hardware to the operating systems to the apps their operating systems run.\n The energy behemoth\n ExxonMobil represents the past, a much-hated American multinational that started with John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil company. The largest of the oil companies and the company with the largest market capitalization in the world right now. They own oil fields, natural gas fields, liquified natural gas factories, tankers and gas stations all across the planet. Some even say that, together with the other big six oil companies, ExxonMobil runs the world.\n They also make a lot more money than Apple. In the first quarter of 2011, ExxonMobil made a $10.65 billion in profit. Apple made $6 billion.\n You could say that there's little vision at ExxonMobil, that the company's money comes out of the ground. There is no Steve Jobs, just liquid gold. Pump it and those billions will keep coming in.\n Even in the middle of oil scarcity, they profit. Prices just go up, and that's the end of it. And because they own this whole energy business thing, and unless someone comes up with cold fusion in a can, they could probably keep doing this for several decades.\n Where would I put my money\n So, if I could invest money in the companies I write about, which one would be my pick?\n As much as I hate the oil guys, I'd pick ExxonMobil for one single reason: They don't have the invaluable advantage and the problem that Apple has.\n ExxonMobil doesn't depend on the man with the vision, the Wizard of Oz, the snake oil salesman, the amazingly brilliant asshole that is Steve Jobs.\n I used to think that Apple could live without Jobs. Back in 2008 I wrote about how he was preparing his farewell and why I thought that, if he left, the company would be just fine. I was wrong.\n Back then, investors disagreed with me. When we broke the news of the return of his cancer back in 2008, Apple lost billions in just a few minutes of trading. Back then, Apple and its friends at CNBC tried to deny the news that later was confirmed by Jobs himself.\n The investors were right, and now I'm convinced that Apple can't be Apple without Steve.\n Steve Jobs' health is probably not going to improve. Eventually\u2014hopefully later rather than sooner\u2014he will be gone. And that will be the beginning of the end for Apple, I'm afraid. Just like it happened with Microsoft and Sony, the company will enter its decline. It will not disappear or crash. It will not go down right away. I'm sure that there's plenty of magical stuff in Apple labs now. But it won't last forever.\n But even during the past few months I have noticed the slipping. Even while they made their best quarter in history, there are signs that execution and vision at the company are failing\u2014from the typography in their ads to the faults of Lion and some of the design decisions in iOS.\n The future\n So, ask yourself the same question: Would you put your stock in a company that can print money even when the oil fields are burning or in money that depends on a genius that may not be with us at any given time?\n What is really the most valuable company, ExxonMobil or Apple?\n \n Related Stories  MiniMash Lets You Pretend to Be an iPad DJ While It Does All the Work\n\n Amazon Student Lets College Kids Trade In Their Hated Textbooks\n\n BGR Claims 4G LTE iPhone 5 Is Being Tested on Carriers", "watchers": [3], "published": "2011-08-09 22:00:00"}}, {"pk": 159, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:41:19", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830263/why-did-apple-obliterate-a-galaxy-from-the-lion-wallpaper", "wikiarticles": [16988558, 28625065, 26199034, 31353, 26727046, 2336870, 412326, 268287, 889902, 12558], "title": "Why Did Apple Obliterate a Galaxy From the Lion Wallpaper?", "content": "Why Did Apple Obliterate a Galaxy From the Lion Wallpaper?\n  Now there are two reasons to change Apple's generic OS X 10.7 wallpaper to a custom one: it's a fake.

Here's how to fix it. \n If you're syncing, Facebook's iPhone app will pull the numbers in your phone's contact file and upload them to Facebook. While it notes that these numbers are only visible to you, Facebook has a way of, let's say, shifting its policies.\n Worse, for many users these numbers are already in its database, and if you're not comfortable with that (and I'm not) you're going to need to manually purge them. \n First, you want to get your phone straightened out so it doesn't sync anymore.\n Using an iPhone, launch the Facebook app in your iPhone and select Friends. Tap the sync button on the top right and tap sync contacts. Turn off syncing.\n If you're on an Android phone, go the main menu, and click on Settings. Under Other Settings, select Sync Contacts.

If I was 15 today, I'd probably do the same things but with skinny jeans on. Not Nick D'Aloisio. He's a 15-year-old kid who makes iPhone apps. And I made him cry. \n If you don't know who D'Aloisio is, he's the kid who made Trimit\u2014an app that shortens websites into something more digestable. Fast Company just wrote an profile on D'Aloisio and called him \"business savvy\" with \"undoubted technical skills\" and \"makes regular old entrepreneurs seem like slackers.\" Pretty high praise, I'd say. So how'd a no-business-sense-having, minimal-technical-skills-possessing 'ol me make this kid cry?\n Here's some background: I'm the \"app guy\" for Gizmodo. Developers e-mail me about their apps and I try to respond to as many as I can as possible, but sometimes, the breaks are the breaks, you know? When D'aloisio first contacted me to cover Trimit, I thought the app's premise sounded interesting enough so I responded saying I'd love to check it out and asked him to send me the details. I also had no idea he was 15-years-old. And then it began.\n To put it bluntly, D'aloisio raped my inbox. And then he raped it again and again and again and again til infinity. And then again. Over the course of a few days, D'aloisio berserker barraged me with over a hundred e-mails about Trimit. I saw him go from calm to excited to a nervous wreck to suffering a nervous break down to threatening to bat shit crazy to borderline suicidal. Here's how it went (each line is a different e-mail FYI):\n  How are you finding trimit? Could you possibly do a post? We'd be so appreciative if you could!\n Could you give me an update regarding an article?\n Are we going to please get a post? We now have over 10 five star reviews and are in top 20 of utilities!\n Casey? Are we going on at 6pm?\n Casey?\n  And then he gets a little on edge:\n  Please reply?! We really need to know if we can get this article out today?\n Casey?\n Please Casey. This is putting the app at jeopardy. Can you just tell me if you could do an article or not?\n Are we likely to be app of the day?\n I'm becoming saddened now :) We really need to know what's going on! Why aren't you replying?\n Nick\n  After I informed him we wouldn't do a standalone post on his app, he kept going:\n  casey? Is it possible? Its cool if not.\n Could you just reply telling us if you could do a real short post (literally!) tonight as well as the App of the Weeks? Thanks for considering it.\n ?\n Casey? Any chance of something today?\n ?\n  At this point, he got fed up with my response time and started e-mailing everyone on the Gizmodo staff. From my bosses to the interns to everyone in between, no one was left out. They all got poked and prodded to the point where annoying wouldn't even accurately describe it. It was like being stuck babysitting the drunk annoying girl at a party you don't even want to be at. And if that party was in hell and the drunk annoying girl started vomiting on you. And if that vomit was actually soul-melting lava. You get the point. Everyone was sick of this half-baked app.\n So, in an admittedly dick move by us, we featured his app as the worst app of the week. Realizing our childish behavior might jeopardize someone's job (at this point he had told us his boss wanted status updates), we just pulled the app completely. It was a promising concept but the app just wasn't good enough. After seeing his app pulled from our Best Apps of the Week list, Nick fell apart (again, each line is a separate e-mail):\n  I can't believe this. Please just put us back on the list. Anywhere.\n I feel like crying I'm that disappointed. Please.\n You don't understand what this means if we don't get featured. We'll go bust and I'll end up unemployed.\n Why have you done this. I can't actually believe this is happening.\n Please, seriously Casey, don't destroy my livelihood.\n I'll do anything just please put us back. Seriously I'll do anything I can't let my boss see this.\n We'd planned so much marketing and SEO for this feature. Now we're not going to get the visibility and get into debt. Casey, you must understand what this will do to us if you don't put us back on the list. I thought you liked the app, why do you want to destroy it.\n Come on man, please forgive me. We all make mistakes. Why didn't you tell me days ago to stop emailing you! I thought you weren't getting them, that's why I kept sending them.\n Seriously without this feature we will lose ranking and then we won't pay back our purchases and then will have to stop the business.\n I plea for you to put it back to how it was before. I plea.\n Now we've wasted $10,000 as we dont have the article to accompany the efforts.\n That puts us in debt and we can't pay that back for ourselves so now I'm going to have to go without food for the next month.\n I am new, we've just started the startup, and I've never been in PR so I'm not familiar with these journalistic conducts and etiquettes I seem to have broken. I was not meaning to hurt any of you guys or disrupt your work at all; none of that was intentional. I WILL GET FIRED now because of all of this but I guess I can't change what has happened now. Our marketing has failed since we were not featured and now I have massive debt which is my responsibility to fix.\n I'll ask you for the final time to understand the seriousness of the situation and change it back to the way it was. What is stopping you? Why ruin my livelihood and my app? Why would you want that, seriously?\n Please man. Please.\n I really need to know what's going on! My boss is asking.\n  Do I feel like a complete ass now that I know he's a 15-year-old kid? Absolutely. He's a kid who was trying to do big boy things and almost pulled it off. His app might even be useful if it had a little more time in the oven. If I wanted to invest in an app developer, I'd put Nick D'Aloisio through etiquette school, manners class, drill him with social skills and most importantly, teach him the basics of how e-mails work (or maybe just strip him of e-mail rights altogether) and then I'd let him work. The kid got unhinged at what happened with the coverage of his app (I would be too at 15) but he obviously has the sort of so-insane-it-might-be-great passion for this.\n So do I wish I never made him cry? Of course, I was 15 once. Do I also wish he only sent me one e-mail? Heh.\n   You can keep up with Casey Chan, the author of this post, on Twitter or Facebook. \n Related Stories  MiniMash Lets You Pretend to Be an iPad DJ While It Does All the Work\n\n Amazon Student Lets College Kids Trade In Their Hated Textbooks\n\n Apple's iPad Cinemax Softcore Porn Problem", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-11 20:37:08"}}, {"pk": 163, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:42:08", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830010/the-lost-origins-of-the-stopwatch-a-story-of-racehorses-and-scrappy-startups", "wikiarticles": [60883, 6615345, 956704, 17883312, 27944981, 2951894, 11447, 10221371, 27945098, 767894], "title": "The Lost Origins of the Stopwatch: A Story of Racehorses and Scrappy Startups", "content": "The Lost Origins of the Stopwatch: A Story of Racehorses and Scrappy Startups\n  Stopwatch. No big deal. You've got one on your wrist, or even on your phone. But it didn't used to be like that. It took a very fast horse and an enterprising company to bring the super-accurate timepiece to America.\n It all started in 1855, when horse racing was a very big deal in the U.S. Tensions between the North and South were playing out on the track. Lexington was a middle-state star with a few successes under his belt when he accepted a challenge to run against the clock. After a series of faster than average loops, Lexington crossed the finish line just 7 minutes, 19 and three-quarter seconds. He had won a battle with a European-imported timepiece, which confirmed a world speed record that would last two decades.\n It was literally the fastest thing anyone had ever seen. So when Lexington blazed around the track and then through the papers, the instrument that gave him his record (timed to the quarter second) also got national\n interest.\n The American Watch Company wanted to tap that enthusiasm. They didn't make the stopwatch that timed Lexington - until then stopwatches were made one at a time by hand. But the company was first in the world to produce machine-made timepieces of the non-stopwatch variety. To change the way the watch was made, they had to completely change the watch. It was classic case of small start up taking on the establishment. And if they could do it with any old time keeper, why not a watch that measures the seconds on demand?\n They became the first to mass-produce the stopwatch, and put out 200 of them between 1859 and 1861. The American Watch Company called it the \"sporting watch,\" and it sold for $50 - up to $300 less than fancy imported models.\n The machine-made stopwatch was patented in 1859 and it was small, about two inches in diameter. \"The dial was distinctive,\" explains the Smithsonian National Museum of American History curator Carlene Stephens. \"The center hand circled the dial once in four minutes. The smaller hand at the foot of the dial circled once in four seconds, and each beat of the watch marked a quarter second.\" A regular watch sat in a circle at the top of the face.\n But the mechanics were a little funky. The first push of a button on the case's side would send both the center and seconds hands to zero. A second push launched the timer into action, but the third would stop the entire timepiece, including the regular clock.\n It didn't get much play. It wasn't until the early 20th century that the stopwatch gained any sort of popularity in the United States.\n A workplace trend brought to-the-second timekeeping into vogue. The popularity of scientific management-a theory that focused on labor productivity and efficient workflow-required precise measuring tools. The stopwatch was a favorite of the theory's developer, Frederick Taylor, who hovered over workers and timed their actions in order to break each movement into discrete chunks for analysis. Fun for management, not so much for the workers.\n Although the work theory was short-lived, the stopwatch persevered.\n By the 1970s, the timepiece got a major upgrade when time technology starting relying on quartz instead of mechanics. The regular vibrations of quartz in an electric circuit meant watches only fell out of time one second for every ten years, which upped the accuracy of precise moment to moment time-keeping.\n For both of their early achievements, Lexington the horse and the machine-made stopwatch that followed him wound up at the Smithsonian. But the city of Lexington, Kentucky recently took the record-holder back after a long lobby for the return of their namesake horse.\n \n Related Stories  The Invention and Evolution of the Drinking Straw, from Mint Juleps to Milkshakes\n\n The Director of Helvetica and Objectified Wants Your Help For His Third Film Urbanized\n\n Gifts for Design Lovers and Jon Ive Wannabees", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-11 20:30:00"}}, {"pk": 164, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:42:25", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5830061/air-forces-experimental-hypersonic-aircraft-disappears-again", "wikiarticles": [108145, 13726812, 18595, 3928108, 18895385, 764257, 102510, 25197709, 108257], "title": "Air Force's Experimental Hypersonic Aircraft Disappears Again", "content": "Air Force\u2019s Experimental Hypersonic Aircraft Disappears Again\n  I don't know what the hell is going on with the Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle 2, but the Air Force just lost it again. Last year, the first Falcon vanished over the Pacific Ocean, leaving absolutely no trace. \n Now it has happened again. The Falcon HTV-2 launched today from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on top of a Minotaur IV Lite rocket.\n After successfully separating from the missile, the Falcon reoriented itself for reentry using its Reaction Control System. During the reentry, it used RCS and its aero controls to fly into Earth's upper atmosphere, passing to the pull-up phase, which put it in the correct altitude for the glide phase. In theory, during this phase the Falcon was going to test its aerodynamics and integrity flying at Mach 20, experiencing temperatures of 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014enough to melt steel.\n DARPA controllers at Vandenberg acquired signal from reentry to some time into the glide phase. At that point, only 36 minutes after launch, they lost telemetry contact never to get it back again. According to DARPA, the Falcon has automated self-destruction controls in case something goes wrong, but they still don't know what has happened. Two hours ago at the time of this writing they haven't followed up on their last Tweet.\n Back in April 2010, the first Falcon flew for nine minutes before DARPA experienced loss of signal.

Which one will win as they battle to the death?\n John's Phone was created to be a simple, cheap phone that you wouldn't mind taking on hikes because you don't really care if you break it or lose it. The iPhone 4 is... well, it's the iPhone 4. Let's see how they stack up!\n Battery\n The iPhone 4 will generally get you through a whole day without needing to be charged. That's actually fairly good as far as modern smartphones go. If you turn off the radios you can probably get 2+ days. John's Phone? It lasts up to THREE WEEKS between charges. Take that, iPhone! Winner: John's Phone\n Address Book\n The iPhone 4 has a whole application that is dedicated to contacts. You can store a gajillion of them with pictures and all their various info, and then you can use that info across the operating system. The address book on John's Phone is literally an address book. It's a small paper booklet attached to the back of the phone. It also has a small pen attached in the way that styluses are on smartphones, so you can jot down your friends' contact info. While I like the retro element, Winner: iPhone 4. You can just do a lot more with it.\n Making Calls\n John's Phone makes phone calls! The iPhone 4... Winner: John's Phone\n Screen\n The iPhone 4 made waves with its Retina Display that stomped everyone else in pixel density. It's very, very purty. John's Phone's tiny, two-color screen only displays incoming phone numbers, but I mean you can't see the pixels within those numbers even if you pressed your eyeball up to it! And what's the DPI of pen on paper? Oh, okay, fine. Winner: iPhone 4\n Dialing\n The iPhone 4's touchscreen is extremely responsive, and that makes dialing fairly easy. John's Phone, however, has big, raised bumps for number keys. You can quickly and easily dial blind-folded! 'nuff said. Winner: John's Phone\n Durability\n The iPhone 4 may be mostly metal, but its beautiful screen has been known to crack when dropped. John's Phone? It may be plastic, but it's so light that dropping it isn't going to do much, and there's just nothing really to break. Winner: John's Phone\n Price\n With a two-year contract you can get an iPhone 4 for about 200 bucks. If you go sans contract the full retail price is about $650. Ouch! John's Phone costs just $\u00a360 without a contract! Just pop in a SIM card and you're good to go. Winner: John's Phone (big time) [Correction: John's Phone is 60 POUNDS, not dollars. It's the equivalent of about $97.

That's why LAPTOP extensively tested the four major carriers in five cities nationwide\u2014using phones, USB modems, and mobile hotspots\u2014to determine which networks truly deliver on 4G's promise.\n How We Tested\n We conducted 4G testing in Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Orlando, and San Francisco. In three locations within each city, every product was tested to find out how quickly it loaded websites, and how fast it uploaded and downloaded files (using both real-world and synthetic tests). In each location, all tests for each carrier were performed during one sitting.\n We used Speedtest.net for our synthetic upload and download tests. We averaged 10 test results for each device in each location. To get real-world benchmarks, we downloaded a 155MB file (OpenOffice.org) from our FTP server. We also uploaded a 6.7MB Handbrake file to the same FTP. If it took more than 7 minutes to perform either of these tasks, it was counted as a failed attempt.\n The Results\n Speedtest.net Results Compared\n As you can see from the above results (click charts to embiggen), Verizon Wireless' 4G LTE network crushed the competition in the Speedtest.net app, a synthetic test that measures throughput. In our five cities nationwide across three devices Verizon averaged 12.3 Mbps down and 4.7 Mbps. T-Mobile turned in a solid 4.7 Mbps average download, but that's 2.6X less than Verizon.\n  Large File Download/Upload Speed Results Compared\n Verizon's lead wasn't nearly as pronounced in our large file download and upload tests. When pulling down a 155MB file from an FTP server, Verizon averaged 4.4 Mbps. That's 1.35 Mbps better than second-place T-Mobile. We also uploaded a 6.7 Mbps file to the same server, and Verizon finished 670 Kbps ahead of T-Mobile. Sprint and AT&T weren't even close.\n  Website Load Times Compared\n A few seconds here and there doesn't sound like a lot, but over the life of your device it definitely adds up. Verizon Wireless once again proved fastest in our Site Load Time test, averaging 10.18 seconds when loading popular sites on a 4G LTE phone and on a laptop connected to a 4G hotspot and with a 4G modem attached. T-Mobile turned in a good 12.59 seconds, followed by Sprint and AT&T.\n Verdict\n There's a reason why AT&T and (presumably) Sprint are moving to LTE. It's a superior technology. As a result, Verizon Wireless' 4G network consistently delivered better speeds than the other big three national carriers in our testing. We'd like to see less dropped connections and smoother 3G-4G hands-offs from Verizon's devices, but overall the provider offered much faster speeds. Although you'll pay more for Verizon's 4G phones versus competing carriers, to us the speed boost is worth the premium.\n If you're looking for a good 4G deal, consider buying a smartphone, connection card, or hotspot from T-Mobile. You'll pay $20 less per month versus Verizon for a phone, and you'll get very good speeds in more locations. Sprint's solid 4G download speeds earned it a third-place finish. While we appreciate the carrier's unlimited plans, the network wasn't very reliable. Not suprisingly, AT&T brought up the rear,because the carrier simply doesn't offer 4G speeds in many markets yet.\n Carrier By Carrier Results\n AT&T\n Sprint\n T-Mobile\n Verizon\n Related Links\n Top 8 Smartphones\n Verizon Wireless 4G MiFi 4510L Reviewed\n Sprint MiFi 3G/4G 4082 Mobile Hotspot Reviewed\n Laptopmag.com brings you in-depth reviews of the hottest mobile products, the latest tech news, helpful how-to advice, and expert analysis of the latest tech trends.\n \n Related Stories  iPhone 4 Vs The Simplest Phone on the Planet\n\n The Best Way to Store Stuff in the Cloud\n\n The Best Streaming Music Service", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-10 16:02:53"}}, {"pk": 167, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:43:11", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5829983/htc-buys-beats-all-your-bass-are-belong-to-them", "wikiarticles": [24855387, 1071803, 8083, 1275656, 19644137, 14260687, 19323800, 198584, 25755766, 14193166], "title": "HTC Buys Beats: All Your Bass Are Belong To Them", "content": "HTC Buys Beats: All Your Bass Are Belong To Them\n  HTC just shouted to the world that it has made a massive investment in Beats By Dre to the tune of $300M. Here's what it means for everyone involved\u2014especially you.\n What It Means for HTC\n For starters, the speakers on HTC phones and tablets are going to start sounding a lot better. Beats has been partnering with HP for a few years already, putting some suped-up audio into their laptops, and they sound pretty damn good (for being laptops). Essentially HTC is going to try to corner the mobile device audio market by having better speakers than anyone else\u2014an area where they're currently flailing. Their speakers have been pretty lousy at best, and Motorola has been blasting them off the soundstage. Now? Not so much.\n What It Means for Beats\n Well, it means they're going to have a lot more money to play with. More cash for R&D should translate to more innovation, if they spend it wisely. Beats, the brand, is owned by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, and they work with Monster to manufacture their branded hardware (headphones, speakers, etc). They'll continue to operate autonomously (so Monster will probably still be making the hardware unless they sink into hell), and they'll still be putting Beats into Chryslers cars and HP laptops. Beats will also enjoy greater exposure outside the audiophile world.\n What It Means For Dr. Dre\n $175 MILLION\n What It Means For You\n Starting this fall, HTC's devices will have way better tunes (honestly it'd be hard for them not to). As more and more people are using phones as their primary listening device, the mobile music race is really going to heat up. HTC just made a $300M bid to win it. Beats has proven that they can pack big sound into small spaces and if they can successfully do it at the smartphone level then HTC will likely set a new aural bar that the competition's going to have to try at least try to match.

And, because it's 2011, they're using technology to organize. Well, as much as a violent mob can be organized. But British Prime Minister David Cameron wants to cut them off. He's very, very wrong.\n And he's wrong for the exact same reason that the governments of Saudi Arabia and UAE were wrong a year ago. Cutting off the use of Twitter, Facebook, BBM, or any other digital means of discussion, is an infringement upon an entire society\u2014not just the destructive malcontents. Cameron's plan\u2014if you can even call it that\u2014would target individuals suspected of riot plotting, and then block their access to BBM and social networks. Somehow. How do you discern who's organizing riots, and who's just retweeting? Do you kick them off of the entire internet? Are they allowed back on? The extent to which this makes little sense and is technologically dubious is representative of Cameron's reasoning here. We balk when a Middle Eastern autocrat threatens to shutter BBM, but when the Prime Minister of a sophisticated, liberal society proposes the same thing, the western world gives him a chance to explain himself. Surely, there must be some rationale! We oughtn't be so fair.\n Cameron's motive is no less ignorant and diffident than any Saudi king\u2014he's afraid. Afraid of what the kids in the street are talking about on Twitter. And he's ignorant; ignorant because Twitter and BBM and all the rest aren't the cause of the unrest\u2014they're just a means. They're, like every other piece of technology, merely a tool. Parliamentary member Tom Watson called Cameron a \"Luddite,\" the FT notes, adding that \"technology is neutral.\"\n And he's mostly right. As the Financial Times points out, Twitter's been \"effective in organizing clean-up efforts and ad-hoc support for those affected by the rioting than it had been in bringing looters out onto the streets.\" A vague crackdown could inadvertently target people who are trying to mitigate, not advance, the rioting. Tech can be used for starting riots, or it can be used for fixing them. The window-smashing pedestrians didn't stumble upon Twitter and think, My God, we could use this to organize a bloody great riot! Their impetus to violence formed long before they tweeted.\n So if Cameron blocks BBM et al., affected rioters will just switch platforms. Lest he down all of Britain's access to the internet and jam its radio waves, the cause of all the youthful vitriol will bubble out of one digital teapot or another. Until the mob mentality can be dissolved, whether by reason, force, or both, no held-down off switch will end the burning.

Seven months later, it finally arrived in the U.S., complete with a vast library of 16 available albums. Its price? $1000.\n At the time, it was seen as too pricey for the average consumer, but well within the fiscal wheelhouse of audiophiles. Stereophile Magazine loved it's lack of background noise and deep bass. They frowned at the digital compression (it's flat and cold, after all). But ultimately looked past that little problem and called the CD the most exciting thing since the advent of the LP. But what's most entertaining is their description of using the player.\n  This one is lower and wider, has a horizontal drawer that slides out to accept the disc, and has much more flexibility of control. Audiophiles will however be dismayed to note that there is nothing on it to adjust; there isn't even a knob to diddle. But there are plenty of buttons.\n After the unit is turned on, a touch of a button opens the loading drawer. The disc goes in label-side up, playing-side down. To close the drawer, you can push the same button again or simply select a band for playing.\n  CDs maybe in their twilight years, especially with the rise of streaming music, but the CDP-101s combination of quality, portability and durability made it a legendary device for its time.\n Image via Atreyu/Wikipedia\n \n Related Stories  The Light that Changed Film\n\n Phonovision: Imagine Recording TV onto LPs\n\n Don't Let Cable TV Be the Monster in Your Living Room", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-10 21:20:00"}}, {"pk": 173, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 14:44:23", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5829662/the-5-worst-pieces-of-advice-apple-ever-got", "wikiarticles": [89847, 20647724, 23501895, 7412236, 2593693, 8841749, 856], "title": "The 5 Worst Pieces of Advice Apple Ever Got", "content": "The 5 Worst Pieces of Advice Apple Ever Got\n  Steve Jobs didn't care about any of the advice that pundits gave Apple back in the day.

Invest heavily in Newton technology. \u2014 Wired, 1997\n Newton was cool, but not that cool. Instead we got a single OS that runs everywhere, from the desktop to the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, which use the ARM family of chips the Newton used to run on.\n 4. Apple should adopt Windows. \u2014 John C. Dvorak, 2006\n To kill itself, he meant. And he said this after Mac OS X was already a reality.\n 3. Apple should pull the plug on the iPhone. \u2014 John C. Dvorak, 2007\n You gotta admit he was hilarious. Of course, he didn't know that the iPhone was going to be Apple's key to taking all over the world.\n 2. Get out of the hardware game. \u2014 Wired, 1997\n It'd have been silly to get out of the hardware game when it gives huge margins and makes it possible to control everything in the platform Apple owns.\n 1. \"What would I do? I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.\" \u2014 Michael Dell, 1996\n Dell now has a $25.82 billion capitalization, with sad sales and margins. Apple is now at $338.39 billion, with insane sales, profits and margins.

So, would I replace my beloved nic-sticks with a Fifty-One Trio E-Cigarette if given the chance? Short answer: nope. \n Like\n Obviously, yes, the Trio is great because you get all the nicotine and none of the other bad\u2014the ash, tar, carbon monoxide, or the hundreds of other noxious chemicals present in regular cigarettes (including the smell and smoke stains). Instead, you inhale a vaporized mixture of water, nicotine and Propylene glycol (FDA approved and commonly found in food colorings, mouthwash, and humidors).\n They're a handy alternative for the occasional or social smoker who doesn't want to keep a pack on hand or bum smokes all night. The draw is pretty good, much cooler than normal smoke. It's just a little longer than a Camel Wide and about as thick around, so it looks more like a real cigarette than other available brands, cutting down on the \"Heyyy, what'cha smokin' there?\" drunken inquiries outside your local tavern. The nicotine cartridges sit in the \"filter\" section, last about as long as normal pack and are ludicrously less expensive\u2014about $10 for a pack of six. The cartridges also come in a variety of strengths, 24mg (Plus\u2014Drum hand-rolled), 18mg (High\u2014Dunhill Reds), 14mg (Mid+\u2014Marlboro Reds), 11mg (Mid - Marlboro Lights), 6mg (Low\u2014Marlboro Ultralights), and 0mg (No Nicotine\u2014why are you even wasting your money?).\n No Like\n Despite it being a reasonable facsimile to a real cigarette, it still feels toy-ish and kinda gimmicky. The end lights up when I inhale, which I suppose is to make it more realistic (though it's also available in green and blue). But really, it just reminds me I'm smoking a very small vapo, not a cigarette. Also, it doesn't really taste like a real cigarette\u2014it's closer to hookah smoke or pipe tobacco sans the tobacco.

I took over 200 pictures of the lighter, some without fire, some with a streak of flame, and some with the full flame. Shooting a composite also allowed me to have multiple lighting points with just one flash; lighting from the side allowed me to catch some of the detail in the wind guard, which would contrast with the smooth lighter body. I then stacked the pictures in photoshop, to create the composite and added a median filter to give it a 'too perfect' look.

Well, after trying for several hours to get that shot, we just abandoned that idea and grabbed the brake cleaner. We used an old mirror as the for the reflective surface with great results.\n -Chris McCready\n   Where There's Sparkler There's Fire\n \nThe shooting challenge this week was a good opportunity to use my new 105mm VRII Macro, what a lens! I was experimenting with taking pictures of flames, but eventually moved onto a sparkler I had bought recently. Nikon D90, 1/400 sec, f11, 105mm.\n -Nils Rohwer\n   Nonpareil Marble\n \nI was at a backyard BBQ last night, after a while we got a fire going and there was some kind of metal netting over the fire. I noticed that something interesting was happening to the flames as they came through it; I couldn't see what that thing actually was until I froze it in place with this photo.

It was shot with a Canon 60D, on a Manfrotto Tri-Pod with a 50mm Sigma 1:2.8 DG Macro...The Av was f:8 @ 1/500 sec. the ISO was 640, with a \u20131.3 Step. What I would have rather done was Burn something Really Really Big...But I live in a smallish town and they sort of frown on that sort of thing...\n -Charlie Carroll\n   Minecraft\n \nWhen I saw the idea of fire for the next photo challenge the first thing that popped into my head was the torches from Minecraft. I recently bought the game and ended up playing it for three days straight. I only stopped for fear of blood clots.\n I made most of the blocks from papercraft patterns I found online. I had to make the torch paper model by hand in photoshop, making sure to give each pixel the right color by color sampling from screenshots. I also had a hard time making sure that the torch was proportional to the blocks, and I couldn't get quite the right angle.\n I inserted a birthday candle into the paper torch and lit it up. I was able to take 4 photographs before the blocks burst into flames. This shot is the first one. The only editing done to this photo was an automatic adjustment to the white balance in adobe camera raw, and then resizing in photoshop.\n Even though this photo contains things from Minecraft, I figure it is still within your contest rules because I actually got the block patterns from a third party site and Minecraft really only seems concerned with people stealing the software, not using Minecraft textures to make fun photos. Pentax K20D, f/4.5, 1/10 sec., 400 ISO, 58mm Lens/87mm equivalent\n -Jon Crooks\n   Vapor\n \nLast week a friend of mine showed me a neat trick that involves heating and compressing the remaining alcohol fumes from a liquor bottle. I knew I wanted to try to capture that on capera for this week's shooting challenge. I used an old empty bottle of wine that I had lying around and fueled the flames with Jack Daniel's vapors. Canon 10D. Shutter speed 0\"3 f/6.7 iso 1600\n -Will Aisenberg\n   Firebolt\n \nI was grilling with some friends and put a few too many coals on the bbq. Well, I happened to get an HTC thunderbolt recently and love the camera. So I decided to play with it and take some shots of the flames pouring out of the grill. I think it's pretty damn impressive for a cellphone camera. Only lost a few arm hairs in the making of this shot!

They lack a reason to exist. The myTouch 4G Slide has one, though: to be the best cameraphone you can buy.\n Why It Matters\n The cameras in your average smartphone today are, by and large, pretty okay. But they're generally not good enough to replace a cheap point-and-shoot. The white balance sucks, the color saturation's off, the low-light performance is crummy, whatever. There have been a few exceptions so far: phones from Nokia, some from Sony Ericsson, and the iPhone 4. And it's really the latter that made a killer camera bolted to a phone a mainstream thing, putting one in the pockets of tens millions of people. The myTouch 4G Slide is the first Android phone to make a concerted effort to do that, with an 8-megapixel backside-illuminated CMOS sensor that's exclusive to the Slide for now, and not unlike what we'll probably see in the next iPhone.\n Using It\n Beyond the camera, the myTouch 4G Slide is a totally typical, but totally fine Android phone. It's running Android 2.3 with HTC Sense on top, and it's got a very good keyboard. No surprises. But let's talk about the camera. HTC tries to make it feel very point-and-shooty, with deeper controls than your average phone's camera, for everything from white balance to ISO and exposure. There's also a ton of filters built in, to scratch your Instagram itch. \"Zero-shutter lag\" means it's effectively taking pictures before you press the shutter button, so once the camera app's open, you shouldn't miss anything. The features aren't quite as extensive as a full-blown camera, but it's close enough with perks like face detection, at least for most people.\n \n Like\n It's fast with a 1.2GHz dual-core chip, even with HTC's custom software running on top. The keyboard is huge and clicky. HTC still delivers some of the best materials this side of the iPhone 4\u2014the phone just feels like quality. T-Mobile is fast when it's fast\u2014I was peaking around 7-8Mbps around Georgia. Built-in Netflix, still a relative rarity for Android. The camera is legitimately good. It's quick to shoot; the colors are more accurate, the 1080p video more detailed than the iPhone 4; and the software delivers most of the control an average-but-concerned shooter would want.\n Check out full-sized samples here.\n No Like\n HTC's Sense skin looks terribly 2008 at this point. The low-quality gradients, and weird smatterings of glossy gloss. The faux 3D desktop is gauche. It doesn't make Android any better. T-Mobile in New York isn't fast at all\u2014the best downstream speed I ever saw was around 3Mbps. I wish the shutter button was more useful. Because of the way the phone splits, trying to use the shutter button resulted in camera shake like 80 percent of the time. And obviously a slider phone is kinda chunky.\n \n Should I Buy This?\n If you're on T-Mobile and having a solid camera built into your phone is a serious priority, well, it's kind of a no-brainer\u2014if you don't mind the added heft or Android, which could be two serious downers, depending on who you are.\n \n Specs\n myTouch 4G Slide\n Network: T-Mobile\n Screen: 3.7-inch, 800x480 resolution\n Weight: 6.5oz\n Processor and RAM: 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon, 768MB\n Camera: 8-megapixel stills, 1080p video (rear);\n Storage: 4GB internal + up to 32GB SD Storage\n OS: Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) + Custom Skin\n Battery: 1540 mAh\n Price: $200 with two-year contract", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-09 18:00:00"}}, {"pk": 268, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-16 16:04:09", "creator": 2, "url": "http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/07/19Apple-Reports-Third-Quarter-Results.html?sr=hotnews.rss", "wikiarticles": [7412236, 2593693, 276598, 15313354, 6963544, 8841749, 856], "title": "Apple Reports All-Time Record Revenue and Earnings", "content": "Apple Leadership                          \n                           Product Images & Info                          \n                           Press Releases", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-07-19 22:41:48"}}, {"pk": 269, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-16 16:04:14", "creator": 2, "url": "http://www.apple.com/ipad/business/profiles/standard-chartered/?sr=hotnews.rss", "wikiarticles": [305981, 312912, 8841749, 499767, 4354196, 30129772, 21098993, 18983527], "title": "Multinational Bank Goes Mobile with iPhone and iPad", "content": "Play>\n  \n \n     Watch Again>\n  \n \n \n Multinational banking goes mobile.\n \n   Standard Chartered Bank is an international bank with 1800 branches on six continents, dozens of recent industry awards, and steadily increasing profits through organic growth and acquisitions. iPhone and iPad provide a perfect platform to expand the bank\u2019s mobile services, both internally and to its increasingly tech-savvy customers.\n In the wake of the 2009 global financial crisis, Standard Chartered Bank immediately set to work reinforcing customer relationships. \u201cAs a leader in the industry, we needed to regain customer confidence,\u201d says Mary Huen, Head of Consumer Banking in Hong Kong. \u201cAnd rebuilding that confidence is not about just pushing products and services \u2014 it\u2019s about using the best technology to foster deep, longstanding relationships with our customers. It\u2019s about helping them manage their money better.\u201d\n iPad and iPhone enable the bank to forge new customer connections and strengthen existing bonds. \u201cWith iPhone and iPad, we\u2019re really looking at the next generation of banking,\u201d says Todd Schofield, Global Head of Enterprise Mobility at Standard Chartered Bank. \u201cManaging our customers\u2019 money is a responsibility we take very seriously, and our mobile services reflect that.\u201d\n Global and Mobile\n With a particular focus on Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, Standard Chartered sees immense potential to expand its mobile banking services among its increasingly tech-savvy customers. For consumers, the bank has developed Breeze, a suite of mobile banking and lifestyle applications. Corporate customers use the bank\u2019s Straight2Bank platform, which includes a mobile authorization app that gives corporate treasurers better control over transactions.\n Internally, Standard Chartered has already deployed thousands of iPhones to employees worldwide. \u201cFor us, the obvious choice was iPhone,\u201d says Jan Verplancke, Group CIO, Standard Chartered Bank. \u201ciPhone creates an environment that\u2019s easy. You can tap into the mobile world and bring applications to people on the go.\u201d \n The bank is also rapidly expanding its internal iPad usage to help personalize customer service and simplify everyday business activities. \u201cStandard Chartered is at the forefront of innovation,\u201d Huen says. \u201ciPad helps us innovate by improving the way we interact with customers and provide services. Now we can be with our customers wherever they want to be in the branch.\u201d\n Banking on Internal Apps\n As one of the first and largest corporate banks to standardize on the iPhone, Standard Chartered Bank has developed more than a dozen in-house iPhone apps, which qualified employees can download from an internal app store, the Standard Chartered App Centre. These custom-built apps streamline internal processes, securely transmit financial data, improve communication between customers and banking staff, and even tap into back-end systems such as PeopleSoft and SharePoint for management approvals and collaboration.\n One example is the bank\u2019s proprietary TradePort app, which enables Trade Finance Relationship Managers to securely perform or monitor trades on the go using their iPhones. Another valuable app is FX Rates, a real-time foreign exchange tool that shows Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s own internal rates and ratios between currencies. \u201cWith FX Rates, a person in our trading room has up-to-date, holistic views of our exchange rates at any given time,\u201d Verplancke notes.\n In Hong Kong, one of its largest markets, Standard Chartered Bank uses iNeeds, a custom iPad app that lets Relationship Managers in bank branches create client profiles and explain the benefits of products such as savings accounts or mortgages via direct, one-on-one interactions. With iNeeds on iPad, bank employees gain a clearer understanding of customer priorities and can offer more relevant products.\n \u201ciPad redefines the way our Relationship Managers connect with their customers,\u201d Huen says. \u201cWith iNeeds, they\u2019re able to introduce products in a more engaging way, while deepening their understanding of that customer\u2019s needs at that point in time. Together they can work on customized solutions on the spot. Everything becomes very simple, effective, and user-friendly.\u201d\n To develop its internal apps, the bank relies on a small team of programmers, graphic designers, and interface experts \u2014 and the tools and guidelines included in the iOS Software Development Kit (SDK). \u201cThe SDK is very standardized, which means that our apps are more stable and consistent across many different apps,\u201d explains Schofield. \n Securing the Future\n With a world of sensitive financial and personal data to protect, Standard Chartered is vigilant about security on its mobile devices. \u201cWe are a bank, in the end, so security is of utmost importance,\u201d says Verplancke. \u201cAs we are present in different markets, different regulations apply to us, so we always take the highest common denominator on security.\u201d\n Fortunately, iPhone and iPad are up to the task. \u201ciPhone and iPad allow us to securely restrict our internal systems with VPN access,\u201d Schofield says. \u201cWe use the encryption that\u2019s built into iPhone and iPad, and we use our Exchange servers to implement security policies such as remote wipe.\u201d\n The bank also offers enhanced mobile security features for its customers, such as text messages confirming ATM activity. \u201cOur job is to give people the tools that allow them to feel secure and counteract fraud,\u201d Verplancke explains. If a customer gets a message about a transaction he or she didn\u2019t make, \u201cone tap on your phone and you're connected to our customer service department, which will block that transaction.\u201d\n With the security, convenience, and ease of use that iPad, iPhone, and custom apps bring to its operations, Standard Chartered is well prepared for the challenges \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 of this new era of banking. The bank has begun introducing location-based services to its mobile capabilities, and is exploring new features like augmented reality to make the user experience more profound.\n \u201cA lot of the things that we\u2019re doing existed before,\u201d Verplancke reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you couldn't put them together in an easy way. And that has a value.

Apple left unchanged the minimalist aluminum-and-glass design while switching to Intel's Sandy Bridge processors, AMD graphics chips and adding the new Thunderbolt port for high-speed connections with peripherals.\n The new iMac still looks great, and it's even faster.\n That sums up what Apple has done with its all-in-ones, with the biggest change being the introduction of Thunderbolt, a technology that's definitely still ahead of the curve but could prove to be quite popular down the road.\n Specs and prices\n Like the previous generation, this iMac lineup starts at $1,199 for a 21.5-in. model with a 1920-by-1080-pixel resolution screen and $1,699 for a 27-in. version, which sports 2560-by-1440-pixel resolution. There's also a high-end $1,999 model, which comes with a 3.1GHz quadcore i5 processor; this is the model Apple provided for my review.\n All iMacs feature Intel's Core i5 quadcore processors (and you can upgrade to an i7 if you need more speed), a 720p wide-angle FaceTime camera for high-definition video chats, 4GB of memory, and at least 512MB of video memory. The entry-level model uses an AMD Radeon HD 6750M video card with 512MB of RAM; the pricier iMacs rely on the AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB of video memory. (You can double that to 2GB on the 27-in. iMac, but it'll cost you $100.) The $1,199 model has a 500GB hard drive; the rest come with 1TB of storage, which can be expanded to 2TB or combined with a solid-state drive for a more responsive machine. \n All of the changes Apple made to the lineup match the company's past practice of beefing up hardware while leaving prices intact, yielding a thoroughly modern all-in-one computer, with a sharp, bright screen that's perfect for editing movies, organizing/editing photos, watching streaming video or making your own presentations. Best of all, the iMacs come with Apple's iLife suite of apps -- iMovie, iPhoto, GarageBand, iDVD and iWeb. I still haven't found any software quite as intuitive -- or as easy to use -- on the Windows side that beats the iLife suite.\n For the environmentally conscious, the iMac meets Energy Star 5.2 requirements, and is rated EPEAT Gold in the U.S. and Canada.\n The iMac still comes in the unibody form factor Apple rolled out several years ago. The main iMac chassis is carved from a single slab of aluminum for solid, seamless, quality construction. The design is an instant attention-getter, and this iMac was a draw no matter who was visiting, regardless of technical proficiency. The silver of the aluminum and the black framed-glass remains striking; it's minimalism at its best, while still incorporating needed functionality. For instance, the deep black border around the screen hides the HD FaceTime camera and a green LED, which lights up when the camera is on.\n Enter Thunderbolt\n The iMac has the same retinue of ports and wireless networking as before, with one very important addition: the inclusion of the new Thunderbolt port.\n Thunderbolt was developed by Intel and implemented as the DisplayPort connection on Apple products. (If you've purchased a new MacBook Pro since February, that port you've been plugging your display into is a Thunderbolt port.) \n   Though the newest iMacs sport updated technology, they still look the same as before.

And, unlike SpaceShipTwo, you'll be able to be up there for a couple of hours instead of just a few minutes. \r\n The ticket price will also be less expensive than Virgin Galactic's rocket plane, but not that much. While a trip in SpaceShipTwo will be a whooping $200,000, in Bloon\u2014the name of this aircraft\u2014you will have to pay a sightly-less-whooping $156,000 seat. The differences don't end there: SpaceShipTwo will get you up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) while Bloon will only reach 36 kilometers (22 miles). That also means that you will not be able to experience zero gravity, unlike with Virgin Galactic's wonderplane.\r\n You will, however, see the curvature of Earth and its atmosphere for about two hours. An experience that people have seen before on other balloons, according to zero2infinity's founder and CEO Jos\u00e9 Mariano L\u00f3pez-Urdiales:\r\n  The first people who described the earth as a blue ball were not in rockets. They were flying in balloons. [...] A balloon stays for a longer time than a ballistic parabola. A suborbital vehicle is limited by the laws of ballistics and only lasts a few minutes. It can only last so long where the sky is black and the view is beautiful.\r\n  I'm sure it would be absolutely amazing but... well, it just will not be the thrill of getting to cruise altitude on WhiteKnightTwo and then experiencing the rocket firing up at full throttle inside SpaceShipTwo until you reach sub-orbital altitude.\r\n L\u00f3pez-Urdiales had this idea a long time ago, after working for the European Space Agency and Boeing, but the company just completed their first round of funding from one of Spain's most important banks. That's good, because that means they seem to be on their way to achieve their objectives. And the more people that compete in this arena, the cheaper it will get. Faster too.\r\n Would you pay $44,000 extra to get up to 100 kilometers in a rocket-plane like SpaceShipTwo and experience zero gravity for a few minutes? Or would you rather pay just the $156,000 to see Earth's curvature, its atmosphere and the blackness of space from 36 kilometers?

Although he has noticed a reduction in traffic into the strip mall, he said his neighbors seem to be holding up.\n \"Things are fine here,\" said Paul Swanson, manager of the nearby Batteries Plus store, who deferred further questions to corporate headquarters.\n That supports the contention from city and county officials that they have received few complaints from companies about a loss of business.\n That means the $118 million first phase of the project, the largest in Dakota County history, is in sharp contrast to other construction projects on busy commercial roadways in the Twin Cities.\n Along University Avenue in St. Paul, months of light rail construction have led to complaints about a lack of parking, a loss of customers and some businesses possibly failing.\n \"It's a large, challenging project,\" Todd Blomstrom, Apple Valley's public works director, said about the Cedar project. \"But I think it's going well. I have not received a lot of complaints. Having two lanes open has allowed good [traffic] flow. People have been patient.\"\n Ross Beckwith, the Dakota County construction engineer in charge of the Cedar project, said the work is about a quarter of the way done.\n Bus rapid transit is described as bus service that mimics light rail. Instead of a train on tracks, it relies on buses running in dedicated lanes between stations. Like a train, the buses will stop at every station, with a new bus coming along every 10 to 15 minutes.\n On Cedar Avenue, the dedicated lanes will be on the shoulders.\n Beckwith attributes the relatively few complaints from businesses during construction to the outreach program and an ongoing notification system that allows merchants to keep abreast of the project.\n \"We spent a lot of time working on communications,\" Beckwith said. \"It takes a lot of time. But we want to get it right.\"\n The worst hit so far appear to be the thousands of drivers who pass through the area on a normal workday.\n \"This is wearing very thin,\" said Rebecca Gander-Banat, who commutes through Apple Valley from Lakeville on her way to work in West St. Paul. \"It's not just driving to work, but for groceries, shopping and most other errands.\"\n Doug Greiner, an IT consultant who lives near Apple Valley High School, said his normal 20- to 30-minute commute has nearly doubled.\n \"I am a lifelong Apple Valley resident and commute daily ... to my job in downtown Minneapolis,\" said Greiner, 29. \"Morning traffic on Cedar Avenue has always been a nightmare ... with the construction the traffic is even worse.\"\n He and others have taken to looking for alternate routes, such as following Galaxie Avenue as far north as possible. But those alternatives also get congested.\n \"It is very frustrating right now with the levels of traffic and commute time,\" Greiner said. \"It will be for the better when it is done and the BRT is up and running, but it is going to be tough until the work is done.

About eight years ago, the office faced the ax another time, Mendota Mayor Brian Mielke said.\n \"We were able to save ourselves from that again. Now it looks pretty serious,\" he said.\n Mendota's office was selected to be reviewed when the Postal Service announced plans last month to consider closing 88 Minnesota outlets, on top of 29 others that had been announced earlier, as the agency deals with reduced demand and growing losses.\n In the small city of Mendota, where mail is not delivered to homes, residents and officials say shutting the post office would leave a void. That's why they say they are willing to fight for it.\n \"It's just an important thing to keep the identity of this place,\" said Jennifer Otto, 63, of Mendota Heights.\n If the post office were to close, people would need to go to Eagan or the post office near the airport to get their mail, City Council Member Joan Perron said during a meeting last week.\n Convenience is key, agreed City Council Member Alan Ralston.\n \"Right now we are able to just walk to the post office and get our mail, get our stamps, mail our packages,\" he said. \"You got a person standing there at the office all day long waiting to serve you. Maybe that's part of the problem.\"\n The U.S. Postal Service ended the third quarter of its fiscal year with a net loss of $3.1 billion. Total mail volume declined by more than a billion pieces this past quarter, compared to the same quarter last year.\n Toward the end of last month, the Postal Service announced plans to identify and study nearly 3,700 under-utilized post offices for possible closure nationwide.\n Mielke said Mendota's situation is unique. Established in 1854, the city's post office -- which has operated in different locations -- is one of the oldest in the state, he said.\n \"For us in Mendota, we don't have a city hall ... the post office can be a gathering spot,\" he said.\n Greg Barnholdt, owner of the barbershop that leases space in the same building as the post office, agreed that the post office is a place where people meet up and check in on each other.\n \"It is certainly nice, the business I have picked up,\" Barnholdt said.\n He said it seemed illogical for the post office to close since the Postal Service would still have to do some type of delivery.\n If the office were to close, the most logical alternative for getting mail would be for the Postal Service to erect cluster boxes where mail could be delivered.\n The Postal Service has said that many of the offices that will be closed will be replaced by \"village\" post offices where common postal services are offered in stores, libraries or government offices. But Mendota is without those.\n \"We don't have a single store other than a restaurant or a bar that's open to the public. Nothing,\" Ralston said.\n Pete Nowacki, a Postal Service spokesman, said the agency has to do something to try to be more efficient.\n \"We're just getting less and less traffic in these locations,\" he said.\n When making its decisions, the Postal Service will consider the revenue that an office generates, the number of customers served, the proximity of that office to other post offices, and other factors, but historical significance would not enter into the equation, Nowacki said.\n It will be several months before a final decision is announced.\n There will be a public meeting to discuss the possible closure of the Mendota office just like there will be meetings for other communities, Nowacki said. The date hasn't been set, he said. Residents will also be able to voice their concerns through surveys within the coming weeks, he said.\n Nicole Norfleet \u2022 612-673-4495\n \n \n  \n \n   more from south metro\n\n  Shakopee man dies in motorcycle crash in South Dakota \n  Burnsville couple are $228,900,000 richer  \n  Lakeville center displays works of glass artist", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-14 12:46:17"}}, {"pk": 217, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-16 10:10:19", "creator": 2, "url": "http://www.startribune.com/local/south/127598893.html", "wikiarticles": [530094, 119887, 423251, 40469, 2964063, 94981, 260914, 307406, 16827568, 5914952], "title": "Burnsville couple are $228,900,000 richer", "content": "When Tom and Kathleen Morris of Burnsville met with their financial adviser Monday, they hoped they'd hear Tom could retire. But no such luck.\n \"I said, 'Tom, The only way we're going to retire is if we win the lottery,'\" Kathleen Morris said.\n Well, guess what?\n The couple won a Powerball jackpot worth up to $228.9 million, state lottery officials announced Friday. They beat 195.2 million-to-1 odds in Wednesday's drawing with a combination of numbers that Tom, a sales engineer, bought at a Lakeville SuperAmerica that day. He intends to retire Monday.\n \"It's a great feeling,\" said Tom Morris, 61. \"We're going to have fun.\"\n \"We'll live the way we live -- just a little higher,\" said Kathleen Morris, also 61.\n It was the largest jackpot ever won in Minnesota in the recurring numbers game that is played in 42 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. There can be more than one jackpot-winning ticket, but the Morrises were the only winners in the latest round. The jackpot has reverted to its floor of $20 million for Saturday's drawing and will continue to grow until there is another winning match.\n The couple has 60 days in which to decide whether to take the money in 30 annual installments or a lump-sum payment worth about $123.6 million ($83.7 million after tax withholding).\n Kathleen Morris indicated she was leaning toward the annuity payments.\n \"I like spreading my fun out,\" she said.\n Tom Morris bought the ticket at the SuperAmerica at 162nd Street W. and Cedar Avenue on his way out of town on business, letting the machine pick random numbers. He normally buys three $1 tickets, but he bought five Wednesday \"because I didn't have $3 in my pocket,\" he said. \"I only had a $5 bill.\"\n The fourth set of numbers was the winner.\n While watching the TV news Thursday, the couple heard a winning ticket had been sold in Dakota County, and Kathleen Morris said it was a shame they hadn't bought one. The first surprise was when Tom produced five tickets. The second was when all six numbers on one of them matched those in the drawing.\n \"I still don't believe it,\" he said. His wife put the ticket in a sealed plastic bag until they could bring it to state lottery headquarters for confirmation. She said she slept less than three hours Thursday night.\n It wasn't their only lucky break in recent days; they became grandparents for the first time last week.\n \"I'm excited for my family, really,\" Tom Morris said, adding that he also wants to help out his 86-year-old mother.\n The payout will be Powerball's largest since a $261 million jackpot in Ohio in June 2010. That winner took the lump-sum cash option of $134.9 million.\n This is Minnesota's 21st Powerball jackpot winner since the game began in 1992.

A gunshot from the underground shooting range sounds like a door being slammed in the upstairs offices. Victims and witnesses of crimes sometimes have to be interviewed in the lobby.\n \"We've adapted to this building,\" West St. Paul Police Chief Bud Shaver said of the 42-year-old City Hall where his department is housed. But compared with other local police departments, his headquarters doesn't stack up.\n The less-than-spacious police department is one of many parts of City Hall that need improvement, according to a new assessment.\n The report ticked off a laundry list of deficiencies and pegged the preliminary cost for an addition and remodeling to be almost $7.4 million. Just performing the necessary maintenance on the current City Hall would cost about $1.8 million.\n Last week, the City Council heard a summary of the report's findings, and while nothing was decided, several council members said that the state of the city's headquarters is hard to ignore.\n \"It's something that's got to be addressed,\" Council Member Dave Wright said.\n Among the findings: The building's mechanical system is outdated and energy inefficient; the roof is leaking, and areas of the building including public bathrooms don't comply with code requirements for quantity and accessibility.\n The police department was found to have significant space problems. It lacks public interview rooms, meaning officers must bring the public into secure areas. Evidence processing and storage areas are inadequate and do not comply with state requirements. There isn't enough indoor squad-car parking to secure electronics and weapons in patrol vehicles.\n \"The lack of appropriate space creates risk for staff and public alike as the demands of the department increase over time,\" according to the report.\n West St. Paul's police department is less than half the size of comparable departments such as Edina and Burnsville, and sometimes little more than a quarter of the size.\n \"You got a lot of things crammed into a little box,\" said John Love, an architect with BKV Group, which prepared the report.\n The assessment lays out the cost of solving the problems by remodeling the current building so the police department could occupy the whole thing, and building a new two-story City Hall and squad car garage.\n The cost estimate assumes that construction would start next spring, and if that changes, costs could fluctuate. Many design and planning issues would also remain to be ironed out.\n It's also unclear how much the council is willing to pay for a better facility.\n \"I think we obviously need to do something,\" Council Member Tony Vitelli said, but he added later, \"I don't think we need a Taj Mahal.\"\n Officials have been looking at the state of the building for a while. A City Hall building committee was formed earlier this year.

The eco-friendly trend in native landscaping is taking root in the suburbs, local gardening experts say.\n \"When people walk around their neighborhood, they don't realize how much of what they are seeing in their neighbors' gardens are native prairie,\" said Dakota County lead naturalist Autumn Hubbell.\n It can create a thorny situation for some neighbors who prefer the traditional hallmarks of suburban living: putting-green-perfect lawns and manicured flower beds. But experts said you can add a little prairie life to any sized lawn with the right mix of seeds and savvy.\n Early fall is an opportune time to start preparations for next spring, said Steve Haines, a sales consultant with Prairie Moon Nursery, a mail-order business based in Winona, Minn., that specializes in native plants.\n Haines said interest in and sales of native plants have grown in recent years.\n \"Everyone is craving to get more in touch with nature. Your back yard is a great place to start,\" Haines said.\n Dakota County's prairie restoration at Spring Lake Park Reserve and Lebanon Hills Regional Park have created a buzz among homeowners interested in transforming portions of their lawns.\n \"People come into the park and say, 'Oh my gosh! Your prairie is beautiful,'\" said Katie Pata, Dakota County parks operations coordinator.\n Last winter, about 300 residents attended classes where they learned how to design and install rain gardens with an emphasis on native plants, said Curt Coudron, resource conservationist with the Dakota County Soil and Water Conservation District. Coudron said the district hopes to expand the classes this year to meet the growing demand.\n Amateur gardeners often first stumble upon native landscaping in an effort to entice butterflies and birds, experts say. Then gardeners start to appreciate the other benefits: While many traditional landscaping species struggle in Minnesota, prairie plants thrive. And once they've taken root, they take less work and usually less watering.\n \"My hydrangea are wilting in this weather, but my prairie flowers are doing great,\" Hubbell said.\n But the wild beauty doesn't woo everyone. The city of Edina sowed seeds of discontent with some residents with its prairie restoration project.\n \"You hear of backlash. Some people are third-generation suburbanite,\" Haines said. \"A prairie will always look like an unmowed field to them.\"\n Other cities, including Eagan, are seeing the trend bloom in neighborhoods, but with fewer objections.\n \"Our ordinance does require lawns be maintained and a height of 8 inches or less, but we enforce on a complaint basis, and we are not receiving any complaints,\" said Joanna Foote, an Eagan city spokeswoman.\n Gardening experts advise homeowners to consider the size of the properties and the character of their neighborhoods when adding prairie plants. Prairie projects can range from a few beds of butterfly-enticing flowers to acres of natural grasses speckled with blooms and humming with wildlife.\n \"If you live in a rural setting, you can plant your whole front yard in prairie. That may not be appropriate for urban St. Paul,\" Hubbell said. \"In that case, planting them in borders may be appropriate; it looks more like a typical garden.\"\n Shannon Prather is a Roseville freelance writer.\n \n \n  \n \n   more from south metro\n\n  Shakopee man dies in motorcycle crash in South Dakota \n  Mendota is protective of post office \n  Burnsville couple are $228,900,000 richer", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-14 04:39:00"}}, {"pk": 222, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-16 10:10:43", "creator": 2, "url": "http://www.startribune.com/local/south/127488863.html", "wikiarticles": [6097240, 2862946, 6883, 1545711, 119900, 1816093, 9984303, 447311, 53837], "title": "Fewer Blockbusters, more Mexican eateries in Eagan", "content": "Two restaurants plan to move into former Blockbuster Video stores in Eagan.

The building owner, Lupe Holdings Corp. of Minneapolis, won City Council approval last week to remodel the 7,000-square-foot building, said city planner Mike Ridley. The space will also hold a hair salon and mobile-electronics store, Lupe told the city.\n Lupe said it has a letter of intent from Chipotle, which would serve liquor and have an outdoor patio at 2075 Cliff Road. A Leann Chin restaurant sits to the east. The Denver-based Chipotle plans to open by year's end.\n Nearly six miles northeast near I-35E, another Mexican restaurant received City Council OK last month for a similar remodeling effort in a former Blockbuster store, Ridley said. Qdoba Mexican Grill, based in a Denver suburb, expects to open in early December at 1298 Promenade Place, near the Yankee Doodle Road interchange on I-35E, said spokeswoman Lauren Preston.\n A third restaurant obtained council approval last week to remodel a 3,000-square-foot space for Zest! Bar and Grill in a shopping center at 525 Diffley Road near Robert Trail on Eagan's eastern border with Inver Grove Heights. Excel Development plans to open the 120-seat eatery near Hawthorne Woods Drive later this year. It also will have an outdoor patio.\n Construction increases in Lakeville\n Business construction also has picked up in Lakeville. The city has issued commercial and industrial permits with a total valuation of $6.1 million through July, compared to $1.5 million through July of 2010.\n Total permits issued, including for residential units, were valued at nearly $37.4 million through July. That compares to almost $33 million a year ago, said Community & Economic Development Director Dave Olson.\n Among those getting building permits is Park Nicollet, which is remodeling yet another former video store, this one a Hollywood Video next to Applebee's in TimberCrest at Lakeville. Park Nicollet will convert a 5,000-square-foot space to an outpatient clinic that will include family medicine, pediatrics and radiology. The building permit value on the clinic is $350,000.\n Park Nicollet awaits a final inspection before opening late in August, Olson said.\n Wal-Mart hopes to break ground in September for a 152,000-square-foot store in Lakeville, about half a mile northwest of the County Road 70 interchange on I-35. The retail giant has received final plat approval from the Lakeville City Council and is applying for a building permit, Olson said.\n The store will sit on about 16 acres near Keokuk Avenue and 207th Street, across Keokuk from the Lakeville 21 Theatre. It's expected to open by September 2012, he said.\n Wal-Mart is also building a slightly bigger store to open next year in neighboring Burnsville.\n Jim Adams \u2022 952-707-9996\n \n \n  \n \n   more from south metro\n\n  Shakopee man dies in motorcycle crash in South Dakota \n  Mendota is protective of post office \n  Burnsville couple are $228,900,000 richer", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-14 04:53:41"}}, {"pk": 223, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-16 10:10:48", "creator": 2, "url": "http://www.startribune.com/local/south/127069898.html", "wikiarticles": [160996, 26100, 296627, 2658906, 655047, 24592945, 21023705, 14443303, 25504097, 5222], "title": "A camp for culture and community", "content": "Varo Zembryki finishes a Latin dance class and walks toward the cafeteria, which has been turned into a Latin American craft market for the day and is buzzing with activity.\n Before long, the 17-year-old boy is caught in the embrace of two 10-year-old girls, both eager to talk about what they've seen and ask what they will do next. Their ages differ, they live in different cities and they may not see each other again for a year. But a single story unites the trio -- all of them have been adopted from Latin America. Zembryki was born in Colombia, the girls in Colombia and Guatemala.\n Once a year they gather with hundreds of other kids who share that link to a faraway place to learn and support each other at La Semana, a weeklong day camp held at All Saints Catholic Church in Lakeville.\n \"Right here, I feel like I just fit in with everybody,\" said Zembryki, a rising senior at Washburn High School in Minneapolis who has been coming to camp since he was a first-grader. Now he's an ayudante -- a helper and mentor for the younger kids -- in the tradition of those he looked up to at camp when he was younger. \"It's so much fun. I make sure they want to come back.\"\n La Semana was born 30 years ago when a group of parents united behind the idea that their adopted children should learn about their Latin American roots.\n What started as a group of about 100 kids has grown to 479 this summer, guided by dozens of alumni and hundreds of parent volunteers. The younger students learn Spanish and traditional dances and do crafts. This year's theme has been celebrations throughout Latin America, including Carnaval and D\u00eda de los Muertos, known in English as Day of the Dead.\n \"On a day-to-day basis, they are Americans,\" said Bernice Tenquist, one of the camp founders and a mother of three children adopted from Colombia. \"But they need that cultural context of who they are.\"\n In addition to culture classes, the students spend time in a \"life\" class that covers adoption-related topics, adjusted for appropriate age levels. As they get older, the campers transition to more service projects and volunteering to keep the camp running.\n Parents, all of whom are required to volunteer in some way, can attend seminars on a variety of topics, such as planning trips to their children's birth countries.\n All three of Tenquist's children have grown up attending the camp. Her daughter Emily, 31, returns each year to teach Latin dance, leading teenagers through salsa steps as they prepare for the end-of-week fiesta on the stage at Lakeville South High School.\n \"You gain a comfort zone,\" Emily Tenquist said. \"You don't feel like a minority.\"\n She said that with some topics, especially questions about race or discrimination, it's easier for the kids to approach their peers than their parents, many of whom are white.\n Jim Stromberg, a parent of two children adopted from Ecuador and chairman of La Semana, puts it this way: \"They all share a story in their heart, a story they might not ever tell us [as parents]. They look around here and see the other kids. Those kids have the same story.\"\n For Raquel Bee, an 18-year-old from Eden Prairie, that meant she had a group of friends who understood as no one else would what it was like when she found her biological family in El Salvador. Like Zembryki, Bee is an ayudante and bubbles with enthusiasm about her third-grade friends, who she has guided through camp for three years.\n \"There's not a whole lot of things that are better than how much they love you,\" Bee said. \"You get to share stories.

She also co-owns a company that has recently won a number of Darpa contracts\u2014something that has prompted the Pentagon's Inspector General to launch an audit.\n There are no signs of wrongdoing. According to a letter released by the IG, it's just \"the first in a series of planned audits to review contracting processes\" at Darpa. \n Dugan's history\n Dugan was appointed by the Obama administration in August 2009. Before that, she was a program manager at Darpa from 1996 to 2000. She co-founded RedXDefense in 2005, a company that develops detection and defense technology against explosive devices.\n After becoming director of Darpa, RedXDefense won a $1.7 million research contract. Talking to Wired's Danger Room, Darpa spokesman Eric Mazzacone said in March that Dugan didn't have anything to do in the contract with RedXDefense:\n  At no time did Dr. Dugan participate in any dealings between the Agency and RedXDefense related to the contract.\n  Back in April, Dugan's deputy said to Danger Room that everyone at Darpa had conflicts of interest, since everyone is tightly connected to the defense industry.\n Darpa's freedom\n Perhaps that's exactly why they are launching an audit into every contract, to make sure everything clear in the $3 billion budget research agency.\n Darpa is one of the most amazing research agencies. They have brought us a lot of incredibly amazing stuff over the years, things have literally changed the world for the best, like the internet or the Global Positioning System. Sometimes they lose a plane or two, but that comes with the job.\n Their amazing work doesn't come from specific requests by the military. Darpa is unique because they have a big budget that they choose to spend in whatever they thing may be a good technology breakthrough. Then they think of ways to apply that breakthrough to the needs of the Department of Defense. This is a quote from their own mission statement:\n  DARPA looks beyond today's known needs and requirements. As military historian John Chambers noted, \"None of the most important weapons transforming warfare in the 20th century \u2013 the airplane, tank, radar, jet engine, helicopter, electronic computer, not even the atomic bomb \u2013 owed its initial development to a doctrinal requirement or request of the military.\" And to this list, DARPA would add unmanned systems, Global Positioning System (GPS) and Internet technologies.\n  Part of that is the freedom to spend their budget as they want which, beyond the government watchdog groups' pressure on Dugan's case, is the real reason behind this series of probes.

A Delta Meteorology app provides access to pilot-tailored graphical weather information and real-time looped Delta radar. Each pilot will have access to their Delta e-mail account and calendar,\" said Dickson. \n \"The tablets have also been loaded with a writing app for notes, an Atomic web browser, a PDF viewer, a Wi-Fi finder app, and crew rest and cruise rest period calculators. Both Wi-Fi and 3G are available domestically.\"\n Delta has already fitted its domestic fleet with Gogo's air-to-ground (ATG)-based in-flight Wi-Fi solution, and has been studying connectivity options for its international fleet.\n The carrier's goal is to determine the viability of tablets to allow it to remain continuously connected with its pilots.\n \"Where we are currently constrained for touch points between the OCC [operational control centre] and Flight Ops, a tablet device opens the door for us to have nearly unlimited communication access,\" said Dickson, noting that the carrier can push important information to pilots regardless of location in real time.\n \"Imagine having searchable information for all facets of the operation that is always up to date with 'pushed' information. We can use a tablet device to transform our training and eliminate different operating system limitations,\" he said. \"Our IROP [irregular operations] recovery time will decrease with instant communication capability.\"\n The Delta executive said the carrier can also explore on-line base visits where pilots can interact with leadership from anywhere in the world. \n \"We are going to pursue real-time security advisories, reroute information and electronic auto sign-in when [pilots] are in range of the airport or a specific gate. A tablet device sets the foundation for a paperless cockpit of course with flight plan and charter packet uploads, theatre guides and trans-oceanic step by step information, simplified NOTAMs, e-Checklists, and instant reporting access just to name a few opportunities. Essentially, we have only begun to identify the limitless possibilities, and there is no question that we see this as a potential to change the way we do business both immediately and long-term,\" added Dickson.\n Once the iPad tests are complete, Delta will swap the platforms to 16 Motorola Xooms with Android OS by mid-September.

Each tester has been authorised to use the tablet pre-flight and above 10,000ft, and all participants have been advised that the tablet is to be used only for operational purposes. \n \"Although the focus is currently on our domestic operation due to constraints with Wi-Fi and cellular contracts, the evaluator pilots come from all fleets and include instructors, Line Check Pilots, AQFOs, and ALPA and Chief Pilot Office representatives,\" said Delta. \n \"Over 50% of the testers are line pilots currently not holding any additional positions.

IATA calculated economy travel increased 4.8% in June compared with growth of 5.5% in May. \nThe association stated that trade growth has declined from the high single digits in the second half 2010 to low single digit rates year-to-date in 2011, while business confidence \"has been declining over the last several months to now rest on the borderline between output expansion and contraction, which will also be dampening growth\", said IATA. \nIATA concludes that with world trade expanding at a slower rate and business confidence barely in positive territory, \"premium passenger markets are expected to show further growth over the months ahead but growth rates are likely to run at a slower pace\". \nEconomy travel declined slightly after sharp rises in April and May, said IATA, but the association stressed economy passenger numbers remain 4% higher than the high point prior to the recession. \nPassenger yield performance is varying by market, IATA stated, as the US airlines have reflected higher fuel costs in their yields due to relatively tight supply-demand conditions. But that is not the case in other regions, and industry-wide IATA estimates premium revenue expansion at an annual pace in the low teens. \nOn a major route basis, the North Atlantic has grown 11% year-to-date, representing 19% of traffic and 30% of revenues. Intra-Europe premium traffic increased 9.4% for June, but IATA cautioned within Europe economic situations vary from country to country, citing Germany's continued strong performance and concerns over Italy and Spain's sovereign debt. Premium travel growth could be pressured as fiscal tightening likely ensues within Europe, the association stated. \nRoutes connecting Europe and the Middle East and Europe and the Far East posted 10-11% premium passenger growth in June, while routes within the Far East recorded 15% growth year-over-year. Traffic along Europe-Far East routes grew 7.4% in June, based on IATA's calculations. \nPremium traffic on North and Mid Pacific routes grew by 3% as those markets are still recovering from the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March while markets to Africa posted lower growth rates compared with traffic generated by the 2010 World Cup football tournament.

In the evening, I got my mother to get out an old raincoat and umbrella that looked appropriate to me, and we went for a walk to the park in the pouring rain. A stroll in the deserted park in a downpour was surprisingly enjoyable. I particularly like this shot because it's pretty bright, so the few things in the photo - figure, bench, trees on either side of the path - show up as silhouettes. The rain on the sidewalk made for some nice reflections, too. This is one of the first successful shots I've taken using the manual settings on my camera (Sony DSC-H20). Or possibly not so successful, since I ended up using iPhoto to adjust shadows, exposure, and contrast a huge amount.

Noire, Mad Men (well it may not be strictly noir, but it's thematically similar), and count Chinatown and Blade Runner amongst my top 5 favorite movies. For this shoot, I was inspired by the L.A. Noire menu screen. Very cool and evocative... Also, my buddy, (the model), got a lot of photographic attention at my wedding because he was sporting the rat pack look to a T... and our wedding was at Frank Sinatra's pad in Palm Springs. We set up the shoot in an alley where I live (Redlands, Ca, USA). I parked my car at the end of the alley with the headlights on. I had my buddy throw handfuls of flour in front of the headlights in an attempt to capture the light beams. It worked well in this shot because I was able to get a good shillouette of our model (Ryan Luce). Of course the slight breeze got the flour all over my car, but hey art's forever, right? ;)\n Canon Digital Rebel XT, 17-85mm zoom @ 30mm, f/22, 2.5 second exposure, ISO 800, B/W conversion in PS CS4 with some minor editing.\n -Colin Robertson\n   Adorable Horror Film Baby\n \nOur south facing windows let in a lot of sunlight making mid-day naps sometimes difficult to achieve, but it gives my daughter enough light to stay mesmerized by her mobile, and just enough to provide a great noir scene.

My first thought was to have a detective type guy squatting over a chalk outline of a body in a dark alley, trying to fit the pieces together of just what had happened. That shot turned out pretty good and I was happy with it, but then my friend told me we had roof access to his business. We scoped it out and I knew I had to change up my plans. I like the tension in the shot and am curious about what's going to happen to our dear detective. Many thanks to our friend Ryan who was a good sport about being directed by someone who seemed to know exactly what he wanted, and me. Canon Rebel T3i, f/8, .8 second exposure, ISO 6400 for that grainy look\n -Colin McLellan\n   Gas Station Hotel\n \nTook this while I was on a hitchhiking trip with my friends in South Korea (which is where I'm from). Not very film noirish, I know. But I thought the lighting from the gas station in the back and the thick fog we had, and my friends who fell asleep in the middle of nowhere, made an impressive scene.\n It was around 3 o'clock in the morning when we were dropped off at this service station. And it was so foggy at the time, nobody was driving out of the station, so we waited and waited until the fog died down. By the time somebody finally picked us up, it was almost dawn. We were trapped in there for almost 3 hours. Canon EOS 7D, Canon EF-S 17-55 f/2.8 IS, ISO: 3200, Exposure: 1/60, f/2.8, Focal Length: 17mm\n  Smoke In the Rain\n \nI shot this early this morning (8/15) just as my friends from out of town were pulling out of my driveway to leave for the night. I was sharing a cigarette with my friend when the rain and the car lights reminded me of your contest for this week so I had my friend hold his cigarette out a little to his side and got the shot off before the car turned down the road. I'm a big fan of the bit of smoke coming of the cigarette and I love film noir (favorite= Maltese Falcon). As far as specs go: Canon 7D at 1/60 at 24 mm with a 24-70 f 2.8 at f/3.5 and ISO 800. All I did was place it in greyscale and a basic grain filter from photoshop.\n -Jordan Kenna\n  I'm equal parts proud and ashamed of how many of you clearly own a full wardrobe of 1950s detective gear, kept pressed and in the ready at all times, right in the front of your closets.

Again. Pretty soon Apple will likely sue them back. Again. Shrug. Throw it on the pile. And while the patent Cold War continues to heat up, weep for the real casualty: innovation.\n I'm not a lawyer. Hell, the last time I watched Law & Order, Jerry Orbach was still flashing badges. But I am someone who's watched the tech industry eat away at itself for years now, playing the world's most expensive tower defense game with bought and sold ideas. Patents are hoarded like gold and brandished like swords. Which would be fine and good, if they were protecting old products and not destroying the new ones.\n As we've said before, the problem today isn't really good ol' fashioned patent trolls. They're shakedown artists, sure, and that's despicable, but at the end of the day all they really want is money. Money that could be better spent by the big boys on R&D, sure, but the Lodsys types are a gnat.\n The lawsuits that Apple and HTC and Samsung and Nokia and everyone else with skin in the mobile game are throwing at each other, though? Those are dangerous. They're dangerous because Apple doesn't want cash; they've got more than the entire US government. Neither does anyone else, really. What they're all gunning for is market advantage. Which, in the most extreme case, means pulling the Galaxy Tab 10.1 off EU and Aussie shelves altogether. They're not playing Monopoly anymore. They're playing Highlander.\n I spoke with Venture Capitalist and author of the influential tech blog Above the Crowd Bill Gurley, who pointed out that \"The [patent] Cold War aspect basically defines certain markets as 'out of bounds.' You can't do mobile OS now. CPU is likely tough. Video CODECs are a mess.\" Three crucial areas, cut off from from disruptive progress because of our system's failings.\n And that's just one consideration. Gurley also noted that equally important factors\u2014non-operating patent filers (the aforementioned trolls) and the patenting of business processes\u2014have done every bit as much to stymie innovation.\n So why have we gone off the deep end? Why are smartphones an afterthought when Google pays billions of dollars for Motorola's mobile business? Why can't a company even blink a new tablet without lawyers pounding down the door?\n Simply put, and thoroughly laid bare by Nilay Patel over at TIMN, software patents aren't a real thing. Or rather, they're classified in a way that's totally counter to their actual function, leaving enough of a grey area that nearly anybody can sue over nearly anything. And, as Apple showed when they blocked the Galaxy Tab, they can win.\n Billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner (and one of the biggest winners of the late-90s tech bubble) Mark Cuban recently suggested that we just scrap software patents altogether. A better answer is probably to write specific language into patent law to cover the unique properties of software. As for litigation, Gurley recommends moving to a system\u2014similar to what the UK and France already have in place\u2014where the losing party pays. That would, ideally, head off countless baseless suits at the pass.\n Again, I'm no Sam Waterston. I just know who gets hurt in the broken system we have now. And it's a long list:\n \u2022 Small start-ups who either shy away from improving on products in litigious areas, get sued into oblivion before they can actualize a great idea, or get bought up solely for their intellectual property\u2014which ends up not getting made.\n \u2022 Large companies, the Samsungs and Apples and HTCs, who spend billions of dollars on patent acquisition and litigation\u2014which could be better spent on R&D.\n \u2022 You, gadget-lover, whose desire for the latest and greatest runs directly counter to the directives of the patent wars. It slows things down, it limits choice. It destroys the marketplace of ideas in favor of a shadow world, where the only products you get to see are the ones that get past a beleaguered team of IP lawyers.\n That's essentially every part of the tech ecosystem that's infected by this parasite. What can you do? Ask your representatives for patent reform (if you're looking for an outline of what to say, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos kind of nailed it back in 2000). That, and hope that the great patent Cold War doesn't devolve into a thermonuclear disaster.\n  You can keep up with Brian Barrett, the author of this post, on Twitter, Facebook, or Google+. \n Related Stories  Jeff Bezos Wants to Put an Airbag on Your Smartphone\n\n When Will Apple Integrate These Pico Projectors It Just Patented?\n\n Does Google's Patent for Shipping Notifications Mean They Have UPS, FedEx and USPS by the Balls?", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-16 16:42:20"}}, {"pk": 209, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-15 17:13:51", "creator": 2, "url": "http://gizmodo.com/5831022/googles-16-biggest-acquisitions-so-farand-what-happened-to-them", "wikiarticles": [24732344, 1092923, 24855387, 12610483, 4338696, 3524766, 30752816, 1680819, 9874319], "title": "Google's 16 Biggest Acquisitions So Far&mdash;And What Happened To Them", "content": "#5: Postini email security and services, $625 million\n \u00a0Google bought this company in June 2007 and integrated its add-on email services, like spam-blocking and archiving, into Gmail for business users.

In addition the security cables are a pain to remove and setup.\n -Difficult to implement devices that would render a computer useless after its removed from the store. Demo iphones have their SIM card trays glued in so that nobody else can use it.  However, none of this will stop a burglars.  They know that there will be unsuspecting consumers that will unknowingly buy stolen merchandise without knowing the product is actually useless\n -Trapping a potential burglar can also raise some serious legal issues\n -Apple does pay security guards to sit at the store during at certain stores during certain times of the year.  This is largely ineffective as the guards are powerless to do apprehend a burglar, they can only take notes and report it to the police.  In addition, many of the guards are underpaid, and there have been instances where the guards themselves start stealing from the store or are involved in assisting people rob a store.\n Reply\n \n      Actual Apple Employee August 10, 2011 at 2331    Okay fine Greenwich.

Building permits filed by Apple with the city say the glass replacement will cost $6.6 million, a figure which probably doesn\u2019t include the cost of making the glass panes. The overall cost of the project could be $10 million, an amount only Apple would spend to make an icon even more iconic. Update: The Gothamist has posted a rendering of the final cube design, showing fewer hardware connectors but retaining interior support fins of glass.\n The original Fifth Avenue glass cube was erected in 2005\u20132006 and reportedly cost $7 million. The glass was manufactured by Seele GmbH in Germany, using state-of-the-art technology which, at the time, limited the length of laminated glass panes to 32 feet in length by eight-feet wide. Using those dimensions, Apple\u2019s architects came up with the unique cube design, which has become an architectural and cultural icon in New York City and beyond.\n The glass technology back then meant there had to be six columns of panes on each of the cube\u2019s four faces. Each column was three panes tall. The top of the cube was similarly constructed of a six-by-three pattern of panes. At each vertical seam, there is a glass support fin set at right angles. There are five fins on each face, each consisting of three panes. The top panes are also supported with fins, for a total of 75 support panes. All of the panes are\u00a0all connected by unique hardware designed by TriPyramid Structures Inc.\n The Fifth Avenue cube retained its unique standing until 2009 when Apple\u2019s designers began casting about for ideas to make the Pudong store special. Their concept of a 40-foot tall glass cylinder was imaginable, but not yet technically possible. Seele did not have the equipment to make the glass that large. Even if they did, import tariffs and politics dictated that a Chinese company should supply the glass. A search led to\u00a0North Glass Safety Glass Co. to supply the laminated panes. The company had already manufactured some glass panes for the West 14th Street (NYC) and Sanlitun (Beijing) stores. The panes were curved for the former store and over 27-feet long for the latter, a company executive has said.\n But North Glass had a big\u00a0challenge for the Pudong store: make perfect 41-foot tall panes, larger than any ever made. After a year of work and inventing new manufacturing methods, North Glass successfully made the 12 side panes that make up the cylinder, and the pieces that make up the top.\n View photos of the Fifth Avenue glass cube during its grand opening in 2006.\n   This rendering was obtained by The Gothamist, apparently from Apple, showing the final cube look. Some connecting hardware is visible, but the number is greatly reduced. There are still support fins on the inside of the cube.\n \n   This explanation appeared on the side of the scaffold cover at the Fifth Avenue store, explaining how the glass cube will go from 90 panes of glass to just 15 after the replacement. The figures do not show the supporting fins on the inside at each glass seam of each design..\n \n   This diagram of the 32-foot glass cube appeared on promotional material for the Fifth Avenue store when it opened in 2006. The support fins are visible in this view as lighter lines on the inside of the cube, along with the glass awning over the door. The connecting hardware is not shown in this view.\n \n   The simplified design will eliminate much of the connecting hardware that is visible here in the old design, focusing the design more on the glass panes.\n \n   The Pundong retail store's 40-foot tall glass cylinder design in Shanghai (China) was the motivation to create larger glass panels. The manufacturing techniques that a Chinese company developed led to the Fifth Avenue cube replacement design.", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-10 04:11:02"}}, {"pk": 249, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-16 15:51:40", "creator": 2, "url": "http://www.ifoapplestore.com/db/2011/08/09/canadas-20th-store-to-open-saturday/", "wikiarticles": [218232, 29991137, 856, 29990850, 249171, 10953705, 501016, 30182396, 2593693, 223578], "title": "Canada\u2019s 20th Store To Open Saturday", "content": "The grand opening of the Conestoga (Ont., Canada) retail store on Saturday will mark 20 stores in the country, keeping it the second most-popular international location for Apple stores behind the UK.

NGDP falls 5%, and 5% of workers are laid off. Now the unemployed workers lower their wage demands by 20%. Why not by even more? Because of minimum wage laws, unemployment insurance, fear of loss of prestige, etc.\n Suppose companies are not worried about workers making invidious comparisons (a big if, but I\u2019ll grant this point to my opponents.) In the best case scenario firms lay off 4% percent of their workers and hire back the 5% who are unemployed at the same total wage bill. The excess unemployment is now 4% instead of 5%. The total unemployment rate falls from 10% to 9% (assuming 5% is the natural rate.) No big deal, we are still deep in recession. Thus wage flexibility among the unemployed doesn\u2019t really help very much. If all employed workers accepted a 5% pay cut (or if the government ordered such a cut) and the Fed kept targeting inflation, we\u2019d experience rapid economic growth.\n Most of all, I praise Scott for being the only respondent, of many, to actually try and explain why nominal wages are sticky.\n As the argument is presented, I would respond: \u201cThere is talk of fixed NGDP and talk of a fixed total wage bill.\u00a0 Both conditions are assuming away the possibility of an easy solution.\u00a0 An unemployed worker shows up, he and the employer cut a deal, a job is created, monetary velocity goes up, NGDP goes up, and the Pareto improvement occurs.\u00a0 To use a different terminology, velocity should be elastic with respect to available gains from trade and thus so is NGDP.\u00a0 More concretely, referring to the current day, employers are sitting on plenty of cash.\u00a0 There is nothing in the NGDP identities to prevent further hiring from that stash.\u201d\n You can read Scott\u2019s not-easy to-summarize counter-response to a comparable comment of mine here.\u00a0 I do not interpret it as defending the relevance of nominal stickiness over the longer run or even as hoeing to the above passage.\u00a0 For instance Scott writes \u201cthe actual change in NGDP is a sufficient statistic for understanding the net effect of wage flexibility on NGDP, PLUS monetary policy on NGDP.\u201d\u00a0 I believe Scott could have more accurately written\u201d: \u201cthe actual change in NGDP is a sufficient statistic for understanding the net effect of labor market and other coordination breakdowns on NGDP, PLUS monetary policy on NGDP,\u201d removing wage stickiness from the sentence altogether.\u00a0 We\u2019re back to viewing wage stickiness as one component of GDP problems, without knowing how important wage stickiness for the unemployed is, which is precisely where we started.\n      0 comments", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-16 20:32:14"}}, {"pk": 253, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-16 15:56:17", "creator": 2, "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/marginalrevolution/feed/~3/mHPhty6obCc/assorted-links-193.html", "wikiarticles": [22130, 161947, 4874, 18337810, 504634, 214343, 2873035, 64904, 6741021, 102910], "title": "Assorted links", "content": "Barry August 16, 2011 at 2:37 pm    It\u2019s fascinating what psychologists can pass off to the public as science.

Everyone uses more nouns than verbs when writing; you only need one verb in a sentence, but you can pack in as many nouns as you like. A low noun to verb ratio in an essay most likely means that the person is writing short sentences. Perhaps the ability to craft longer, more complex sentences with lots of nouns is an ability of a more intelligent writer, hence the academic success.

In the real world (especially at this level of low skill employment), the management effort to direct people, the risks of theft or vandalism, the losses due to people distracting each other, and so on are high.   In fact, to some limit, I might prefer to pay fewer people more so as to lower the overhead of dealing with the people.\n The ZMP debate is missing a reality of the workplace.   There *are* people who are ZMP people.  In fact, there *are* people who are negative output people, and they can be surpriziingly hard to fire in a large org.\n In the wheat example, hiring will be driven by the size of the harvest, almost one-for-one, directly.

You say:\n \u201cNow suppose that due to climate change or a swarm of locusts the farm only produces 90 bushels of wheat\u201d\n So, I\u2019m assuming that by this 10 workers produce now 90 bushels of wheat (instead of 100, as before). Which means that the productivity per worker is now 9, rather than 10 (as before the shock).\n Then you say:\n \u201cThe farmer doesn\u2019t want to reduce everyone\u2019s wages, however, because that will reduce morale so he fires one worker leaving nine. Each worker now brings in 10 bushels, as before, and is paid a wage of 9, for a total wage bill of 81 leaving the farmer with 9 bushels.\u201d\n In this scenario, each worker has a producutivity of 10, as before the schock! But how is that possible? It\u2019s only possible because the marginal productivity of 9 workers is higher than 10 workers. In fact, after the shock, the marginal productivity of ten workers is 9, and the marginal productivity of 9 workers is 10. But if this is the case, with full flexibility of wages, 9 workers would be paid by their marginal productivity, which is 10. So, it\u2019s not possible to say if wages are stick or not, because with full flexibility they would receive the same money as before.\n I\u2019m probabling missng something here. I\u2019d be very happy if someone could point me what are the holes in my reasoning.\n Manoel\n ps.: is there any capital in this model? If not, why the profit is 10 before the schock? Why not zero? If there is some capital and you say that with wage flexibility the profit would be 10 as before the shock, then you are assuming that the marginal productivity of capital is the same as before (factors receive their marginal productivity). And workers are receiving only 8, which means that the marginal productiviy of worker decreased. Thus, the shock affected only the productivity of workers, not of capital (somehow). But if this is the case, it seems to me that this would induce the farm to save labor, by using more capital and less workers, which would increase the unemployment rate, even with full wage flexibility. Not only that, if this new equiblirium is, say, 9 workers and more capital, and the total output is 90, why the profit would still be 10? It seemsn that the profit has to be the same as the wage. If not, we\u2019re out of equilibrium in the capital/labor ratio\u2026\n and the amount of capital used doesn\u2019t change after the shock, then we\u2019re assuming that the marginal capital is cheaper than the marginal worker, which means that the shock is inducing a more intensive use of capital, right? But this would reduce the marginal produtcivity of capital (assuming decreasing returns) with 10 workers? So, how is it possible that the profit can be the same in the scenario with wage flexibitliy?\n Reply\n \n    DW August 16, 2011 at 12:54 pm    It makes sense if the number of bushels the farm produces is dependent on more variables than the total productivity of the workers. So if the farm only produces 90 bushels because of a supply shock, then the 10 workers are working below peak productivity. If wages were flexible, they might accept a pay cut due to their reduced productivity. But I think most people would like to work at their peak productivity and get paid more, rather than be forced to work less and take a pay cut. The problem is solved (for everyone except the umemployed worker) if the farmer just fires one of the workers.\n Reply\n \n      robbl August 16, 2011 at 11:57 am    Isn\u2019t the real problem that these guys are not producing wheat but Ipods or movie tickets. When one of them is laid off, then the 9 still working worry that they might be next and reduce their consumption of ipods or movie tickets. This makes the Owner even less likely to hire anyone at any wage.\n My just so story is as good as any.

The Census data (http://www2.census.gov/govs/school/09f33pub.pdf \u2013 Table  shows that California spends more per-student than Texas. In 2008-2009, California spent $9,657 per pupil. Texas spent $8,540 per pupil. The national average was $10,499. Note that these are current spending numbers. Total spending (including capital outlays \u2013 Table 11) is greater for CA, TX, and the US. A useful point in this context is that Utah which spends the least ($6,356) outperforms New York which spends the most ($18,126).\n Of course, Hispanic students are lagging in Texas compared to whites and Asians. However, Hispanic students lag whites and Asians in virtual every jurisdiction. The more germane point is the Hispanics in Texas are easily outperforming Hispanics in California and the US.\n The poor performance of Hispanic students nationally is beyond the scope of this note. However, it is worth noting that Latin America performs poorly in standardized tests (PISA, TIMMS) even adjusted for income levels. By contrast, Asian students (in Asian countries) excel even adjusting for income levels. \n More broadly the PISA data shows that immigrant students lag (badly) in essentially every country. Germany has the worst performing immigrants. Canada has the best performing immigrant students (matching or slightly exceeding the natives). Of course, Canada\u2019s immigration system is (partially) skill based and the demographics of Canada\u2019s immigrants are drastically different than the U.S.\n A related point is that if you adjust for demographics, America\u2019s schools are doing rather well. Take a look at \u201cThe amazing truth about PISA scores: USA beats Western Europe, ties with Asia\u201d (http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazing-truth-about-pisa-scores-usa.html). The author presents a wealth of data to substantiate his thesis.\n P.S. Take a look at http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2011/01/california-vs-texas.html for another comparison of Texas and California.\n P.S.S. I live in Texas and have sent my kids to the local public school. With one exception, I have never been impressed even though my school district is one of the best in Texas. The only counterpoint is that my daughter\u2019s 9th grade biology class was at a near university level.\n Reply\n \n    Peter Schaeffer August 16, 2011 at 2:15 pm    Sorry folks.

One, the income generating function of U.S. society takes a vector of Gaussian random variables as input and kicks out a highly kurtotic scalar distribution as output.

While the amount of money is increased, with the threat of higher prices to come, more sales will occur, resulting in more work that on the one hand squeezes margins, but on the other hand spreads fixed costs over more units.\n Which is easier to manage: forcing every price of everything to be reduced, or forcing every price to be increased?

I.e., for any problem in NP we can describe a market problem in which solving for prices provides a solution to the problem in NP.  We would know therefore, that solving the market problem exactly is at least as hard as solving the NP problem, and is therefore probably pretty hard.\n You would not have said much useful.  We already know markets operate as an approximation to perfect efficiency.  We know there isn\u2019t prefect information known by all parties.  We know there are time lags.  We know there are transaction costs.  So how well are we doing?  Are we getting within 1 percent of correct prices in constant time?  Are we consistently off by a factor of two?\n I dunno, and the P=NP question is irrelevant to knowing.  The computation involved in exact solutions really doesn\u2019t say much about the computation involved in approximations.  It doesn\u2019t say how good they are, how good they could be, and how difficult they are to compute.  It\u2019s just not a helpful question.\n  \n\n        Kinch August 15, 2011 at 6:48 pm    What is important to understand is that approximations to NP problems if P != NP are likely to be very bad. (Our best approximation for the travelling salesman problem is terrible). The approximation becomes worse the large the problem size is. \n Thus if P != NP we really are looking at a world where markets as they become more complex become significantly inefficient. As I mentioned the last time this came up \u2013 think about the implications for something like derivatives pricing (Black-Sholes or any EM based system). As markets become less efficient, Black-Sholes like methods become less useful, meaning that risk premiums for even simple derivatives will have to go up, reducing the efficiency of markets further and further.\n P.S. \u2013 this is what I said last time the whole P!=NP thing came up:\n This is a fundamental misunderstanding. You don\u2019t need arbitrarily large numbers to be concerned with whether efficient markets are in P or not. As long as the number of different financial instruments is increasing, prices will be inefficient (assuming this paper says what it does), and in fact, will be increasingly inefficient as the numbers grow. This is because the problem size (if it is not in P) will grow incredibly rapidly.\n Now while the difference between an efficient market, and a bounded rationality efficient market may seem slight, arcane or academic, think about the impact on something like derivatives pricing. If markets become less efficient as the number of financial instruments grows, then Black Sholes pricing (or ANY EM based pricing strategy) will get progressively less correct, and the risk premium asked for by providers of derivatives will need to grow. This has enormous implications about how you think about financial markets, and their overall ability to deliver gains to the world.\n Reply\n \n    Finch August 15, 2011 at 7:15 pm    > What is important to understand is that approximations to NP problems if P != NP are likely to be very bad.\n This is just wrong.  The math of NP problems puts limits on what\u2019s achievable in approximation, but those limits vary greatly.  I.e., you can often put strict bounds on error and approximate in polynomial time.  Sometimes the error bounds are not so strict.  Sometimes there isn\u2019t a useful guarantee you can make.  It depends on the detail of the problem.\n It\u2019s not true in general that approximation is hard.\n Reply\n \n    Kinch August 16, 2011 at 12:09 pm    http://www2.research.att.com/~dsj/columns/col25.pdf\n The linked article appears to disagree with you Finch. I\u2019m pretty sure constant error bounds can\u2019t exist. At best (and this varies from problem to problem) you can achieve a O(sqrt(log n)) bound on optimal. If very good approximations existed P!=NP would be much less important. Of course we likely care about bounds on average case performance, not worst case performance etc.\n  \n\n    Kinch August 16, 2011 at 12:39 pm    And one final reply. Finch is partially right.\n Basically, not all NP complete problems have good approximation algorithms. If market efficiency can be approximated efficiently (pick a threshold for price error that you are willing to accept i.e. 10%, then you can achieve that bound in polynomial time), then I think the impact on things like derivatives prices is small. \n However, a large number of NP hard problems do not have such approximation algorithms (provably so), in that case, you\u2019d really have to start worrying, since the best you\u2019ll be able to do is something like, our prices are within 50% of efficient, requiring huge risk premiums.\n  \n\n            jon August 15, 2011 at 4:35 pm", "watchers": [], "published": "2011-08-15 18:26:50"}}, {"pk": 260, "model": "wikilink.source", "fields": {"dateAdded": "2011-08-16 15:57:33", "creator": 2, "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/marginalrevolution/feed/~3/DzLu9tOthZ8/assorted-links-192.html", "wikiarticles": [29542352, 2461344, 3405848, 29542144, 2690997, 3251923, 374833, 29542712, 6067609, 29542497], "title": "Assorted links", "content": "2.

Probably 50%+ over 25 years. See https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/163390.pdf. See also http://www.csom.org/pubs/recidsexof.html. I quote\n \u201cOne method of dealing with this problem is to examine recidivism studies of specific types of sex offenders. This approach is warranted, given the established base rate differences across types of sex offenders. (Recent research suggests that many offenders have histories of assaulting across genders and age groups, rather than against only one specific victim population. Researchers in a 1999 study (Ahlmeyer, English, and Simons) found that, through polygraph examinations, the number offenders who \u201ccrossed over\u201d age groups of victims is extremely high. The study revealed that before polygraph examinations, 6 percent of a sample of incarcerated sex offenders had both child and adult victims, compared to 71 percent after polygraph exams. Thus, caution must be taken in placing sex offenders in exclusive categories.) Marshall and Barbaree (1990) found in their review of studies that the recidivism rate for specific types of offenders varied:\n     Incest offenders ranged between 4 and 10 percent.\n     Rapists ranged between 7 and 35 percent.\n     Child molesters with female victims ranged between 10 and 29 percent.\n     Child molesters with male victims ranged between 13 and 40 percent.\n     Exhibitionists ranged between 41 and 71 percent\u201d\n The authors point out that all of these estimates may be low. Polygraph data indicates that sex offenders are very active. I quote\n \u201cSeveral studies support the hypothesis that sexual offense recidivism rates are underreported. Marshall and Barbaree (1990) compared official records of a sample of sex offenders with \u201cunofficial\u201d sources of data. They found that the number of subsequent sex offenses revealed through unofficial sources was 2.4 times higher than the number that was recorded in official reports. In addition, research using information generated through polygraph examinations on a sample of imprisoned sex offenders with fewer than two known victims (on average), found that these offenders actually had an average of 110 victims and 318 offenses (Ahlmeyer, Heil, McKee, and English, 2000). Another polygraph study found a sample of imprisoned sex offenders to have extensive criminal histories, committing sex crimes for an average of 16 years before being caught (Ahlmeyer, English, and Simons, 1999).\u201d\n Reply\n \n    Chotawchic August 16, 2011 at 11:16 am    I can post Department Of Justice and state sponsored studies that refute \u201chigh recidivism rates\u201d all day long \u2013 I invite anyone reading this to go to the trouble of doing some research to educate yourself, and not accept \u201cFrank\u2019s\u201d statement here.\n Recidivism rates are high for one small subset of sex offenders, and one only \u2013 the homosexual male offender who preys on little boys.  All others, particularly incest offenders, are VERY low.\n Bottom line \u2013 over 90% of sex crimes are committed by those NOT on a registry.  Over 90% of sex crimes are committed by family or aquaintances trusted by the child.  So while you are fretting and sweating over sex offenders pictured on the internet, Aunt Cindi is molesting your kids (when I confronted her with my suspicions, she in turn falsely accused my teen aged son who is now on a sex offender registry while she is free to molest other children.

No other study replicates the Ahlmeyer study. You also must recognize the term \u201crecidivism\u201d does not always imply the registrant commits a new sex crime. Studies can include rearrests for other things like probation violations or failure to register. In some cases, a registrant has an item otherwise legal to own, like a Playboy magazine, but because of his status, is arrested for a \u201csex crime.\u201d \n There is one factor people fail to consider\u2013 cultural influences play a role in statistics, and there will be a small subset of people who use statistics to promote an agenda. Certain studies have focused on that very narrow subset of serial sex offenders and apply that across the board. However, that is a very small subset.

And it allows faculty to focus on teaching journalism \u2014 rather than managing technology.\n The inspiration\n Since 1908, some of the best journalists in the world have learned their trade at the Missouri School of Journalism through the Missouri Method, a \u201clearn by doing\u201d approach that provides practical hands-on training in real-world news reporting. Technology has always played a role in the Missouri Method. In 1985, the school was the first institution to publish its community newspaper on a local area network, and by 1991 it was producing a daily digital newspaper. But around 2000, school administrators realized that they were not keeping pace with one of the biggest trends in contemporary journalism: convergence, or the reporting of stories through a combination of different media and emerging technologies.\n After an extensive exploration led by Associate Dean Brian Brooks, the school decided to move from a largely PC-based platform to the Mac. Brooks and his transition team championed Mac and iLife as the perfect tools for enabling faculty and students to teach and learn journalism as it\u2019s practiced today, with journalists increasingly required to both report and produce stories for print, TV, and the web. In 2004, Brooks implemented a required notebook computer-buying program, strongly recommending that each student purchase a MacBook Pro. Nearly all of them did, and the program was an instant success.\n The Mac is now a universal presence in the curriculum, which aims to give Missouri School of Journalism students the skills and tools they need to produce work at the same level as any professional journalist. Students use MacBook Pro for everything from recording classroom lectures to newsgathering, writing, and editing for class projects and for the school\u2019s newspaper, TV station, and affiliated online news service. With iMovie and GarageBand, freshmen can quickly teach themselves the basics of video and audio editing before moving on to more complex projects using Final Cut Pro. And because the Mac offers a complete, easy-to-use set of media tools that work together seamlessly,\u00a0faculty can focus on teaching journalism rather than managing classroom\u00a0technology.\n Following its success with integrating Mac notebooks into the curriculum, the school is now looking at adding iPad and iPhone devices as mobile tools for journalism.\n \u201cThe Mac can really transform how we teach journalism in this country.\u201d\n \u2014 Brian Brooks, Associate Dean, Missouri School of Journalism\n The implementation\n Given the scale of the proposed switch from PC to Mac, it was critical for Brooks to get faculty buy-in. In consultation with Apple Professional Development facilitators, the school delivered faculty training, assessment, and professional development sessions to ensure digital competency. Some training was specifically created to help PC users migrate to Mac. After learning how well the Mac fit with the curriculum, the faculty voted unanimously in favor of making the change.\n  Although all students were asked to purchase their own MacBook Pro notebooks, they generally considered the cost to be part of tuition and fees. And because the notebooks have proved to be such effective learning tools, the mandatory buying program has been well received by students and their families.\n The school\u2019s former PC-based platform required significant IT support, chiefly to deal with persistent virus attacks. So the school saw immediate benefits in the switch to the more secure, UNIX-based OS X. And because the iLife applications are so easy to learn and use, students and faculty can now manage their own systems. Together, these factors reduced by half the IT resources required to support administration, faculty, and students.\n The results\n The Mac and iLife created a perfect solution for adapting the learn-by-doing Missouri Method to training media-fluent journalists. A survey of recent Missouri School of Journalism graduates found that 90 percent were employed in journalism, advertising, or PR jobs.\n  Practicing Video Reporting\n The Mac and Final Cut Pro help student journalists create sophisticated multimedia stories.\n As they advance through the Missouri School of Journalism, students use MacBook Pro and Apple applications to create video projects of increasing complexity. For their freshman interest group, Natalie Cheng and Samantha Hill used Final Cut Pro to document their experiences in a Charlie Chaplin-style video with old-school effects. For a senior capstone project, a dozen students pushed their skills and learned new tools \u2014 including Final Cut Pro \u2014 to produce Project 573, an intensive online reporting effort to discover the effect of the recession on typical citizens in Columbia, Missouri.

The weight of it and general feel seems to be what a laptop should be; it isn\u2019t hard to carry around all day (which is a major consideration for me). The battery life is also pretty amazing (I believe this is the case on most Macs\u2026) and boot up times are insanely fast thanks to the SSD.

You can now try CS on her new Air and if it truly doesn\u2019t work under Lion just move the image from the hard drive right over top of the new MacAir, again, using CC. CC is very easy to use and I have 4 Macs in our home between my wife and myself and use it all the time to capture full bootable Images. I have on many occasions used the external drives to boot up from, even on a machine that it hasn\u2019t been created from. This is one of joys of Mac OS; it allows you to do this.

Firstly, the MacBook Air includes the latest Intel Core i5 \u201cSandy Bridge\u201d CPU and a fast solid state drive which provides significantly more performance than the white MacBook\u2019s Intel Core 2 Duo and laptop hard drive. Secondly, the MacBook Air contains next-generation I/O in the form of Thunderbolt where the white MacBook only has USB. Thirdly, the MacBook Air has a smoother glass trackpad for better gesture control. Fourthly, the MacBook Air\u2019s solid state drive enables instant wake from standby, even after 30 days. And finally, the MacBook Air provides a more satisfying user experience overall than the white MacBook due to its backlit keyboard, its higher pixel density display, and its sturdier, thinner, lighter, and sexier aluminum unibody enclosure.\n\n\n\n Keith T\nGreat review Jim!!! I like reviews like Jim\u2019s as they give a real life perspective of the actual machine in everyday use, it is not just a one day (couple hour use) reviewer perspective.\nI have 4 Macs (Brand New 13\u2033 i5 | Air 11\u2033 128GB 4GB | Air 11 128Gb 2GB | iMac 3.06Ghz.\nI just sold the Air with 4Gb after purchasing the MacBook Pro 13 i5 for a couple of reasons only; I do photography and found that screen size was a little too small and processing power was just not enough. I had the Air for around 3 months and at the beginning used it quite a bit as I wanted it to be a \u201con site tether/backup\u201d solution but had a lot of lag when doing any photo processing (used mainly LR).\nAll that being said I really am curious about the new 13\u2033 Air as it is using the new processor. I am disappointed that you can still only have a maximum amount of 4GB of memory in them.\u00a0\nI would also be curious if you can now use OS in 64 bit as this was not possible with the previous models (at least the 11\u2033 that I had)\n\n\n\n Tom\na mac review from a mac obsessive. is anybody stupid enough not to see this as nothing but a mac ad?\nmacs are brilliant. but this \u2018review\u2019 isn\u2019t.\n\n\n\n goose\nMacfan, have you seen the specs for the new Air models? I have the core I-7 256GB with 4gb RAM, trust me it is quicker than a macbook. Unless of course you meant Macbook Pro, even then then difference in speed is now hardly noticeable. Lack of an optical drive is not an issue for most these days.\n\n\n\n tweakers\nWhich configuration did you purchase Jim?\n\n\n\n Steven Fisher\nSometimes, the biggest feature a product can have is a lack of features. Simplicity is definitely worth something.\nI understand that you think the MacBook Pro is a better system for you, and you\u2019re probably right. Me, I\u2019m much more deeply torn. Other than the quad core on the MacBook Pro, I\u2019d prefer a MacBook Air. I think it\u2019s probably worth giving up the quad core rather than getting extra size and weight.\n\n\n\n Christian\nRAD writeup Jim.\nI\u2019m in the music industry, and had NO IDEA that the duet2 had come out. LOVE that they have four outs now (for headphones AND for monitors).\nI wonder if the sound quality is BETTER than that of the Ensemble (which we use to record pretty great vox: levelfourmusic dot com).\nPlus I\u2019m in the market to update my 15\u2033 MacBook Pro. I\u2019m waiting to see what the new lineup gets which is rumored to be released b4 Christmas time. Hopefully a 15\u2033 type air!\n\n\n\n Tina\nOrdered the 11\u2033 the day the update dropped. \u00a0Sleek, thin, and light as\u2026 \u00a0well\u2026 air. \u00a0Yet functionality beats the macbook I replaced. \u00a0Granted, I sprang for the fully loaded model, but it seems to handle everything I throw at it effortlessly. \u00a0Two complaints: 1. \u00a0Lion is a bit glitchy still\u2013not a big deal, but I\u2019m looking forward to updates. \u00a02. \u00a0Battery life could be better. \u00a0That being said, I\u2019m super happy, can\u2019t wait for more Thunderbolt peripherals, and the new backlit keyboard is a major plus. \u00a0I plan to add a Thunderbolt display and daisy chain a couple of external drives for Time Machine backups and heavy-duty storage. \u00a0Then it will approach perfection.\n\n\n\n Joise\nThere is no way I am going to get this what so called \u201cMacbook Air\u201d. I will never touch a laptop equipped with intel graphic ever. Intel graphic sucks as hell.\n\n\n\n Go2thesun\ni still have a \u00a0mac book tiger \u2013 it is the perfect size for most things. It even froze when i did as \u00a0i was homeless. so its looking \u00a0about as disabled and beat up as me, \u00a0but you can\u2019t beat a mac for features, security and \u00a0reliability.\n I will be sad to lose mac mail , but i do dream of updated tech and the \u00a0ideas \u00a0and work it \u00a0could help develop .\u00a0\n\n\n\n Rodney Bugden\nOnce you\u2019ve had Mac you want go back\u2026\u2026\u2026.recent convert from the PC world\u2026.Macbook Pro love it\n\n\n\n DS\nI\u2019m eagerly waiting the delivery of my new MacBook Air 11\u2033 \u2013 maxed out\u2026 \nBeen using a MacBook Pro 17\u2033 and a MacMini (as the PVR), recently purchased an iPad 2 \u2013 in the classroom with the MacBook plugged into a projector and the iPad to control it (via VNC or Remote) \u2013 it is an absolutely fantastically great winning combination.\nPrior to the MacBook Pro 17\u2033, I\u2019d been a PC devotee since computer time began. \u00a0I did like Linux though and, when I found out the OS X was based on BSD Unix, just had to have one. \u00a0I now have 3 Macs (well, 2 and waiting for the new one), an iPad 2, iPhone 3G and will be grabbing an Apple TV next pay.\nLove their products \u2013 they just work.\n \n\n\n\n http://pulse.yahoo.com/_NPJRH4Y3AVX4JE4N3KCIIXCBQQ Newborn\nI have the Macbook Pro and the Air. The Air eleven (the screen). I use almost solely the Air. Why? It\u2019s the real portable. The Book Pro became the desk one, much heavier. Both very good anyway. Never had PC or Wndows because never could bear the dumb interface and the bloating of the OS.\n\n\n\n Michael8852\nI agree the availability of a CD/DVD drive and more memory and larger hard drive makes the Macbook Pro the better computer for serious computer work writher work or school. The Air is a nice second computer maybe for someone with an iMac or Macbook Pro but never a primary computer.\n\n\n\n DAvid\nIf you keep your files on a NAS drive, you should be able to access them no matter the device. Have a look at NAS and media servers to see if they would meet our needs.\n\n\n\n Compton\nlol, Macfan, the Macbook is way worse than the Air in almost all respects. The new i7 Sandy Bridge processor combined with a solid state drive means that it completely destroys it in benchmarks, it has a longer battery life, boots faster\u2026 And when is the last time you used the CD Drive? Just mount an .iso or something, its not 2001 anymore! When you want to watch a movie or something, then you just use a slim external drive that you\u2019re able to carry around with the saved space.\n\u00a0I have been able to do everything I did on my Core 2 Quad w/ a 260M on my Air, faster. And with Thunderbolt, hopefully in the near future you\u2019ll be able to use an external graphics card, with the Sonnet Echo Express. And with the ability to daisy chain, you could turn the new Thunderbolt display into a hub with a high-speed hard drive, a high-performance graphics card, a cd drive, firewire, charging capabilities and speakers all with one cable.\nJust my two cents. The multi-touch gestures are pretty awesome too.\n\n\n\n Akshaya Kumar\nEvery note book have own area, you can not compare in pro & air.\n\n\n\n Glenn Stewart\nThere are a lot of advantages to the Pro. The processors found on the Pro line are a tad faster than the Air. Storage is larger. Dedicated graphics processing is also an advantage.\nBut Macfac, I think you haven\u2019t taken the SSD into consideration.\n There is a 4-7x speed advantage on having the SSD.\nI\u2019ve been editing a large video in Final Cut Pro on a 2010 Air (old) and i7 MacBook Pro (2011).\nA lot of the editing process requires reading and writing to disk, and the Air blows the Pro out of the water with this. But whenever processing was required, the Pro came into it\u2019s own.\nThis current Air takes the processing of the Pro (if not quite) with the speed advantage of the SSD. Add to this the higher resolution screen of the Air, and it proves to be a much better editing machine that the similar sized Pro.\nA 15\u2033 or 17\u2033 with SSD would be comparable, but at a much larger price tag.\nI think Apple have a got a winning product on their hands, and they\u2019ll continue to produce the Pro and Air to satisfy.\n\n\n\n Glenn Stewart\nJust realised you were comparing the Air with a normal Macbook.\n Unfortunately it\u2019s not even in the same ball park.\nResolution: Air higher\n Battery life: comparable\n Weight: Air lighter\n Processor: Current Air 2 to 2.5x previous Macbook\n Disk: SSD has proven 4x minimum of Macbook\nThere is absolutely no need for the old Macbook given the stats.\nApple made the right decision to end its life.\n\n\n\n Skippy_skippy_productions\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is this; thunderbolt has fast throughput so what else is it good for if it can\u2019t capture anything faster than usb 2 on this 13\u2033 air\n\n\n\n Skippy_skippy_productions\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is this; thunderbolt has fast throughput so what else is it good for if it can\u2019t capture anything faster than usb 2 on this 13\u2033 air\n\n\n\n http://pulse.yahoo.com/_GJ5LJ2JBT2IRF2FQON3XEGITHY fishnetchic\ni have both the macbook pro(latest) and the macbook air 11.6, 3 months old.I have started using the macboook air more than the beefier one, why?it is FASTER! Not only is it lighter to carry around, it can do everything i want, so have not needed the macbookpro. i might consider buying the macbook pro 13inch, but right now the little one is fine, you can increase the font size in a swipe action, i plug in a 75gb mini external harddrive, or simply use wifi, bluetooth or soon icloud, so no need for the cd part(although i got the external mac one, thinking i would miss it.i seriously dont.) anyway\u2026mac is great no mater what the choices! I am happy with all roducts and would be happy with either at the end of the day, although I have to admit air is winning right now.the speed is brill.\n\n\n\n http://pulse.yahoo.com/_GJ5LJ2JBT2IRF2FQON3XEGITHY fishnetchic\nabsolutely, like a dream!\n\n\n\n Hasan\nGod bless Apple Inc. ~OM\n\n\n\n http://www.facebook.com/brian.maday Brian Maday\nI hope to get an iBook 13 as soon as my penny collection gets just a bit larger. I would like to make one point \u2013 I recently read that anything that runs under Lion is a \u2018true\u2019 computer, and things that run on iOS are favored by people who don\u2019t necessarily LIKE computers. I\u2019ll be interested on the comments on This one!\n\n\n\n http://mangochut.net/ mangochutney\nWell, iBooks don\u2019t exist anymore, I\u2019m sure you meant the 13\u2033 MacBook Air.\nAs for your question:\nOS X Lion is a desktop operating system just like the previous versions of OS X, Windows and Linux.\n By that logic, yes, anything that runs Lion, whether it be a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini or iMac, is a computer in the traditional sense.\niOS on the other hand is an operating system designed to run on devices like tablets and smartphones.\n They\u2019re not as capable as actual desktop or laptop computers, but they do many things better than a desktop computer.\nWhile I would agree that iOS devices, especially the iPad, are well suited for people who are not very experienced with computers, I don\u2019t think that people who don\u2019t like computers use them, because they still are computers.\nWhat\u2019s different, is that these devices are less complex and often offer a better user experience for certain tasks. Example:\nI have a MacBook Pro with OS X Snow Leopard and an iPad.\n The latter I use for email, calendaring, task management, web surfing, reading books and long form articles and games.\nAll these things I can do with my MacBook Pro, too, but the iPad makes them more enjoyable and easier.\nI hope this helps.\n\n\n\n Sunjik Lee\nMost stupid statement I\u2019ve ever read. iPhone replaces lost iPod sales because iPhone IS an iPod touch with a phone. iPad is NOT a computer, not even close.\u00a0\n\n\n\n Sunjik Lee\nEverything except for flash.

By expressing the over used epithet \u201ckool-ade\u201d, wouldn\u2019t that indicate that the only comment that follows that description here is actually yours?\n\n\n\n http://mangochut.net/ mangochutney\nI disagree. I firmly believe that the iPad did and does cannibalise Mac sales to a certain degree and the numbers Horace Dediu posts on Asymco.com seem to support that notion.\nThe reason for this is that the iPad is indeed a computer, just one for special tasks.\n When I bought my iPad 2, the alternative I considered, was the first generation MacBook Air (11\u2033), but I found that in some areas the iPad was simply more capable so I went with it.\n\n\n\n http://mangochut.net/ mangochutney\nBelieve me, I\u2019m trying to convince myself of this every day, but my wallet disagrees.\nWhen it comes to a desktop/laptop computer I need power and the MBA unfortunately doesn\u2019t fit my needs.

On many trips I take the ipad2 and apple wireless keyboard and in-case origami case, but when I need to work on spreadsheets and use a lot of functions in excel\u2013 nothing beats the MBA.\nAt home the MBA is still my main computer and it has the power for everything, including media.

He was not talking about personal documents and the iCloud.\n64 GB might not be enough for you and it isn\u2019t enough for me, but I know many people, including hard core geeks that can live with 64 GB on a machine like the MacBook Air.\nThe Air is a machine with a special purpose, just as the iPad and the iMac and every other PC. What\u2019s important is whether it meets your requirements.\nAll in all you shouldn\u2019t make blanket statement like this, just because you don\u2019t see how certain aspects of a PC could be useful to you.\nAs for the glossy displays I can tell you this much: They resonate with non-geeks because they offer great contrast, deeper blacks and generally more vibrant colours. They just look better out of the box and many people can live with the trade-off of having to live with reflections.\n The manufacturers originally started using them because they were cheaper to produce; they could omit the anti glare coating, which isn\u2019t cheap.\n \u2014 Personally, I don\u2019t like glossy displays, and I\u2019m glad my MBP doesn\u2019t have it, but I know enough people that do.\n\n\n\n http://pulse.yahoo.com/_XENVNKXRXRIHZBGMN35N44M3VA dreyfus_ffm\nIt is amazing, how Apple\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d works almost every time.

Even as Texas\u2019 unemployment rate rose along the lines of the entire country, the neighboring states of Louisiana and New Mexico saw their unemployment rates fall to 7.8 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively.\u201d\n \u201cThe state added 45,000 natural resource extraction jobs since the jobs trough of the recession. That was 15 percent of all the new jobs added in the state. The oil price bubble has also created tens of thousands of new business service jobs, which are counted separately.\n Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who ends his shadow run for the White House this weekend by announcing his bid for the GOP presidential nomination, has been touting the success of the Lone Star State\u2019s economy, which, he says has done significantly better than the rest of the country through the Great Recession. Perry\u2019s announcement comes exactly in time for this weekend\u2019s Iowa Straw Poll. \n Election 2012 Complete Coverage \u201cWe keep adding jobs while others are losing them left and right,\u201d he told the Republican Leadership Conference during its mid-June meeting in New Orleans. Some analysts say that Perry will enjoy a strong advantage over others in the crowded Republican field because of his state\u2019s near-miraculous record of job creation throughout one of  the worst economic periods in U.S. history.\n There\u2019s just one problem with that portrayal. While Texas has created more jobs than any other state in the past two years, the increase is far less than advertised. The rate of increase is not much higher than a number of other states, including former rustbelt centers like Pennsylvania or liberal sanctuaries like Vermont.\n Moreover, its recent performance is a classic case of \u201call hat, no cattle.\u201d Texas lost 34,000 jobs in June, causing its unemployment rate to jump to 8.2 percent, which ranks it 25th among states and leaving it worse off than its immediate neighbors. Even as Texas\u2019 unemployment rate rose along the lines of the entire country, the neighboring states of Louisiana and New Mexico saw their unemployment rates fall to 7.8 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. \n Moreover, to the extent Texas has succeeded in adding jobs over the past two years, most of its good fortune rests on conditions that are not replicable elsewhere. Soaring oil prices have provided a substantial number of new jobs and tax revenue since it is the nation\u2019s leading oil- producing state, even as those $4-a-gallon gas prices drained consumers nationwide and put pressure on other states\u2019 budgets. An influx of new government defense spending has also pumped up revenue, while the state has used oil revenue to postpone a sharp cutback in state and local government employment, which is about to hit in full force.\n Two other factors that may not play well with Republican Party primary voters also contributed to the Texas   economic performance over the last decade and through the Great Recession. According to a recent analysis in the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram, state debt grew by 282 percent over the last decade, a slightly faster rate of increase than the ostensibly more profligate federal government. Local government debt in Texas grew by a heady 220 percent over the same period.\n Texas also benefited during the downturn by having tighter housing finance rules \u2013 a stark contrast to the business-friendly regulatory environment Perry likes to tout. After the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s, which hit Texas hard, the state legislature prohibited \u201ccash out\u201d mortgages. The state\u2019s tough mortgage rules kept housing prices in check and saved it from the huge price declines and foreclosures that devastated many other areas of the country. Still, construction employment fell by 95,000 jobs during the recession and remains 14 percent below its pre-recession peak. \n \u201cAnyone who thinks the relatively strong performance in Texas has much to do with state government policy is wrong, except when it comes to housing, where regulation helped the state,\u201d said Howard Wial, an economist and fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program. \u201cIn Texas, the worst is yet to come.\u201d\n After assuming the seat held by George W. Bush in 2000, Perry, 61, has been elected to three full terms as Texas Governor, making him the longest serving chief executive in state history. Married with two grown children, he has won plaudits from social and economic conservatives alike for his strong anti-abortion, anti-tax and anti-regulation stands. He also takes pride in his willingness to lure businesses from other states by offering special tax breaks. Asked by a television interviewer why some companies had relocated to Texas from California, he replied, \u201cThey like the smell of freedom \u2013 freedom from taxation.\u201d\n The recession officially ended in June 2009, but job declines continued across the country for most of the next six months, including in Texas. But after oil prices soared to nearly $150 a barrel in 2008 and remained high for most of the past two years, the Texas oil patch and the global oil services industry centered in Houston staged a strong recovery. \n The state added 45,000 natural resource extraction jobs since the jobs trough of the recession. That was 15 percent of all the new jobs added in the state. The oil price bubble has also created tens of thousands of new business service jobs, which are counted separately.\u201d\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n \u201cWe have a huge oil and gas service industry; we\u2019re the world\u2019s center,\u201d said Mine Yucel, a senior regional economist at the Federal Reserve Board of Dallas. \u201cIf oil and gas prices are high, that benefits us because of demand for our services, not just from Texas, but from the entire world.\u201d\n It also benefited the Texas state government treasury, which was able to replenish its rainy day fund with $6 billion after using $3 billion in unanticipated severance taxes to make up for the recession-driven shortfall in the last biennial budget. \u201cLuckily, Texas has underneath it a great deal of oil and gas,\u201d said Dick Lavine, the senior fiscal analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based think tank. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the proceeds from $100 barrel oil flowing straight into the budget.\u201d\n The result is that while state and local governments nationwide have eliminated over 400,000 jobs in the past year, government employment in Texas actually grew. There are now 1.66 million state and local government employees in Texas, an increase of 66,000 in the past two-and-a-half years.\n Yet that didn\u2019t help Texas avoid losing 132,000 manufacturing jobs or 14 percent of the total between the onset of the recession and December 2009. Since the recovery began, the state has regained only 11,000 of those jobs. The information technology sector also remains well below its pre-recession peaks.\n \u201cCompared to the rest of the country, we did better,\u201d said the Fed\u2019s Yucel. \u201cBut we\u2019re not immune. The oil and gas has offset the losses in those other sectors.\u201d\n Continued strong military spending at the federal level also benefits Texas, especially its El Paso and San Antonio metropolitan areas. The Army over the past three years has relocated about 14,000 troops to Fort Bliss, which is outside El Paso, and plans to permanently relocate an additional 6,000 troops there in the next two years.\n An earlier version of this article appeared in The Fiscal Times on July 8, 2011.\n  \n\n      Pragmaticon August 17, 2011 at 1:13 pm    Oh hell guys, Bill wasn\u2019t impressed! Hear that Shapiro?\n You weren\u2019t impressed because Shapiro\u2019s work went against your ideological views- i\u2019m sure you would have been perfectly willing to accept Krugman\u2019s original analysis which was much, much more crude and simplistic.\n Reply\n \n          DRDR August 17, 2011 at 1:23 am    Matthias spends the whole post arguing that Texas is indeed a miracle, but that\u2019s the wrong question to be asking. What matters is whether Perry can credibly scale up the \u201cTexas miracle\u201d to the whole country with conservative economic policies. But Texas has been successful in attracting jobs because (1) lots of open space (unlike, say, New York City) and good land use policy (unlike, say, California) and (2) lower corporate tax rates, which allow Texas to siphon jobs from the rest of the country. Nothing in Matthias\u2019 analysis persuades me that either of these explanations for Texas\u2019 success can yield an employment miracle for the whole country, so I remain unpersuaded. \n Matthias\u2019 advice to anti-Perry advocates is \u201cGive up talking about Texas jobs,\u201d but anti-Perry advocates will have every reason to keep talking about them if extending the Texas miracle is the center of Perry\u2019s platform.\n Reply\n \n    mulp August 17, 2011 at 2:48 am    It would have been a miracle if Perry\u2019s pray-for-rain gathering resulted in rain.\n The oil and gas in Texas is geology, and the rising in oil prices is global demand from rapidly developing nations.\n And Texas having long roots in Mexico makes it far more tolerant of immigrants, it seems.\n So, can Perry come up with national policies for the nation to bring jobs from Mexico into the USA by cutting labor costs and living costs below Mexico so Mexican business men will move to the US like California business men have been moving to Texas and bringing the jobs with them?\n Of course, how many Americans want the US labor market to pay like Mexico.\n Reply\n \n    dan1111 August 17, 2011 at 2:50 am    Interesting points about the limitations of applying these types of policies on a national scale.  \n However, I don\u2019t see this argument working politically at all.  The problem is, it starts with \u201cyes, Perry\u2019s policies worked, but\u2026\u201d  At least that is how it will sound to people.  The main thing it will communicate is even the Democrats conceded Perry\u2019s success.  Then contrast that with how Obama\u2019s economic record will be perceived.\n Reply\n \n    DRDR August 17, 2011 at 11:12 am    Yes, you\u2019re absolutely right. I believe it\u2019s crucial for Obama to have implemented economic policies that he can claim to have \u201cworked\u201d by November, but he\u2019s unwilling to try and it\u2019s probably already too late.\n Reply\n \n      Newman August 17, 2011 at 3:32 am    \u201d (2) lower corporate tax rates, which allow Texas to siphon jobs from the rest of the country. \u201c\n Couldn\u2019t he make the argument that lowering Federal corporate tax rates would allow the U.S. to siphon jobs from other countries?   Canada has dropped their corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%.  It\u2019s hard to imagine that doesn\u2019t tempt some companies to move north of the border.\n Reply\n \n    Rahul August 17, 2011 at 4:02 am    You could argue anything, but the question is empirical. Have previous cuts in corporate tax rate caused significant international migration of firms to the US? How elastic are companies to tax rate changes internationally. The barriers to a firm moving from California to Texas are far lower than one moving from, say, Italy to USA.  In fact, I am curious as to which large firms (if any) have migrated headquarters across national borders.\n Also, is where a firm keep jobs also have to be where it pays corporate taxes? Perhaps the corporate HQ migration in response to a federal corporate tax cut wold be jobless?\n Reply\n \n    Newman August 17, 2011 at 5:39 am    \u201cHave previous cuts in corporate tax rate caused significant international migration of firms to the US?\u201d\n I can\u2019t find a table of past U.S. corporate rates by year, but I imagine the world was a considerably different place last time they were 15 or 20% so I\u2019d be surprised if it was applicable to the current economic environment.  Ireland> certainly seems to think having the lowest corporate tax rate was a key to their ability to attract business.\n Reply\n \n      mjw149 August 17, 2011 at 9:55 am    Our corporate tax rates are already that low, due to thousands of tax cuts and other corporate benefits.  Corporate welfare in this country is out of hand, it\u2019s a nightmare to manage, it helps Congress stay crooked (millions in \u2018donations\u2019 for Boehner, Cantor and Ryan) and worse, it\u2019s unreliable and unpredictable.  It\u2019s anti-capitalistic because it\u2019s based on a closed anti-competitive political system.  GE paid nothing in taxes!  That\u2019s not a good outcome.  This recent infatuation with tax cuts is unproven and unwise, we haven\u2019t been creating jobs in our country outside of the fraudulent banking/mortgage industry.  So RECORD low taxes aren\u2019t working, and Republicans (and their conservative economists) need to explain why.\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/01/AR2010010101196.html\n I think it\u2019s obvious why, just check the news.  Corporations take their tax cuts, give themselves (the CEOS and shareholders) millions more every year and do layoffs.  There is no incentive to hire anyone, since their profits aren\u2019t taxed properly.  Look at banking, broadband, health care, electronics, everything is becoming more centralized and less competitive and China is leveraging their absolute control over their domestic economy to take higher and higher value jobs.  Our national decline shouldn\u2019t be a mystery.\n And, let\u2019s be serious, Perry isn\u2019t an economic genius or innovator.  That\u2019s just silly.  Even if he was successful in Texas, who would trust his credentials to do it again?  No one.\n Reply\n \n        John Thacker August 17, 2011 at 2:56 am    The only \u201cTexas critique\u201d he fails to address is one that I think can be easily addressed, the \u201cclimate/air conditioning/location\u201d effect.  It\u2019s easily disposed of by noting that Texas is growing much faster than its neighbors from New Mexico to Alabama.\n Sure, air conditioning has undoubtedly made the South and Sunbelt more livable, but all the states there have not performed nearly equally.  (Louisiana has its share of energy as well, for example.)\n Reply\n \n    dirk August 17, 2011 at 1:14 pm    \u201cLouisiana has it\u2019s share of energy as well\u201d\n What most people outside the industry don\u2019t realize is that these days most of the oil jobs in Houston are about energy projects taking place outside the state of Texas. The Gulf of Mexico is mostly in federal waters, for instance. Energy knowledge workers in Houston work on projects all over the world. What Manhattan is for finance, Houston is for energy. Yeah, the shale plays have been a boast recently, but Houston as an energy hub is more an artifact of history than a function of the local geology. New Orleans isn\u2019t the bigger energy hub due to factors other than current proximity to hydrocarbons.\n Reply\n \n      Steve August 17, 2011 at 5:13 am    There\u2019s a fundamental reason that environmentalist restrictions are greater in California than in Texas: the environment is more well-worth conserving in California.
